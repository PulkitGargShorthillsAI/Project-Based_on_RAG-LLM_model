HAWA-MAHAL
An architectural marvel of 953 windows
Perhaps the most stunning example of Rajasthani heritage from the time of the Royals is the Hawa Mahal (Palace of Winds), a wonder of wonders that will leave you spellbound with its architectural ingenuity. 

Built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh and designed by Lal Chand Ustad, the iconic Hawa Mahal is a cherished landmark nestled right in the heart of Jaipur. It gets its name from an astonishing 953 windows or ‘jharokhas’ cleverly designed to create a honeycombed cooling system that keeps the palace well-aired and cool, even in sun-drenched summers.

This structure is the jewel in Jaipur’s crown that gives it its iconic look. Speaking of crowns, atop this magnificent mahal rests a pyramidal structure that signifies the crown of Lord Krishna. Owing to this resemblance, it is also fondly called 'the crown of Jaipur.'

A stunning fusion of Islamic and Rajput heritage, the Hawa Mahal's architectural brilliance is evident from its lovely pink façade. However, the real delights awaiting you inside will leave you in awe of its breathtaking splendour. So, let's step inside and witness this amazing marvel.
