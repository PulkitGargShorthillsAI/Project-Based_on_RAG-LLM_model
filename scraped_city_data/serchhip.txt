SERCHHIP
An idyllic haven of nature
Serchhip is not a place that shouts its name from billboards or flaunts its beauty like a peacock. In the heart of Mizoram, where the hills cradle secrets and the rivers hum forgotten ballads, Serchhip is a whispered invitationâ€”a secret shared among the wind, the birds, and those who seek solace in the ordinary.

Nestled amid serene landscapes, Serchhip remains one of the world's most enchanting yet lesser-known travel destinations. This picturesque locale captivates visitors with its untouched beauty, tranquil surroundings, and rich cultural heritage.



PHAWNGPUI-NATIONAL-PARK
Preserving majesty above the clouds
Nestled in the heart of Mizoram, Phawngpui Blue Mountain National Park, also known as the Blue Mountain, stands tall as the highest peak in the state. Overlooking the majestic River Chhimtuipui, this national park is a haven for nature lovers and adventure seekers alike. With a rich variety of flora and fauna, and a multitude of butterflies, the park offers a mesmerising experience that will leave you in awe.



VANTAWNG-KHAWTHLA
Spectacularly refreshing
Located in the serene Serchhip district, approximately 137 kilometres from Aizawl, Vantawng Khawthla is Mizoram's highest and most spectacular waterfall. The waterfall plunges from a height of about 230 metres, making it one of the most remarkable natural features in the region. Surrounded by dense bamboo forests typical of the hills of Mizoram, Vantawng Khawthla offers a refreshing escape into nature's embrace.
