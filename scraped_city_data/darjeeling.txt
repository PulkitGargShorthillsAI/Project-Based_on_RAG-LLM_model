Before the East India Company took over in 1835, Darjeeling was part of Sikkim. When the Governor General expressed interest in acquiring the Hill of Darjeeling as he saw its potential as a sanatorium due to its cool climate, Raja of Sikkim presented Darjeeling to the East India Company, as a gesture of friendship. In exchange for Darjeeling, the Raja received a gift comprising a double-barrelled gun, a rifle, 20 yards of red-broad cloth, and two shawls. Thus, Darjeeling came under British control and became the summer capital of the Bengal Presidency.

With infrastructure development in independent India, Darjeeling has grown into ‘Queen of the Hills’ and also became home to thousands of Tibetans who followed the Dalai Lama to take refuge in India after the Tibetan uprising in 1959.
