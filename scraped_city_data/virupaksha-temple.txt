VIRUPAKSHA-TEMPLE
A prized jewel in India’s spiritual crown
At the heart of Hampi lies an ancient temple steeped in legend and boundless magnificence. A temple with a rich history that spans over 1000 years. A temple with a pinnacle that seems to touch the heavens. And a temple that has the distinction of being a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Welcome to the Virupaksha Temple. 

The Virupaksha temple is a pilgrimage site that holds immense religious significance for Hindus, drawing devotees from far and wide. It is dedicated to Lord Shiva in his form as Virupaksha, meaning “eyes without form.”

From humble origins as a modest shrine in the 7th century, it blossomed into a magnificent complex under the reign of the Vijayanagara rulers, who added their own touches to the temple, making this structure truly one-of-a-kind.
Let’s venture forth and explore one of the most legendary temples in existence.
