BASILICA-OF-BOM-JESUS
A portuguese wonder of the world
Goa conjures up images of ruby-ish, emerald waters flirting with beige-coloured sand, lilting, cozy cafes, and electrifying parties. But it also has churches−lots of them. And in one of its prominent lanes in old Goa lies the Basilica of Bom Jesus, meaning ‘Good Jesus’ or ‘Infant Jesus’.

The Portuguese colonizers built this architectural marvel way back in the 16th century. As you enter the iron gates, you will be spellbound by the Baroque architecture, which has delicate carvings and intricate designs engraved on it. The facade is made of black granite and blends Doric, Corinthian, and composite styles beautifully. It's 183 feet long, 55 feet wide, and 61 feet tall.

This church is India's first minor basilica. It's even considered one of the Seven Wonders of Portuguese Origin in the world! Back in 1946, Pope Pius XII made it a basilica with a special decree called ‘Priscam Goae’. Small wonder, it is marked as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The Church is also renowned for being the resting place of St. Xavier, the revered Jesuit missionary. His remains are preserved in a silver casket for members of the faith to pay their respects.

SAFA-SHAHOURI-MASJID
The oldest mosque and its ‘pure’ beauty
When the Portuguese invaded Goa and went on a violent rampage of destroying its historical monuments, they also didn’t spare its 27 mosques. But in its small town called Ponda, Safa Shahouri Masjid escaped the brutal end, even though it was burned and left in ruins until it was partially reconstructed in the 1980s. This oldest mosque is surrounded by dunes of green and showcases the architectural splendor of Islamic culture against the backdrop of coastal charm.

‘Safa’ means ‘clean, chaste, and pure’ in Arabic. It suits the mosque's design that’s without much extravagance. Dating back to the 16th century, the mosque looks humble, all it does is sing through its vivid simplicity. But if you are looking to have an offbeat experience in Goa, drive down to the Safa Shahouri Mosque, now an ASI protected Monument of National Importance.

SE-CATHEDRAL
The beauty of the Portuguese Church
The most imposing of all the churches in Old Goa, the one with five bells, among them the famous Golden Bell−the biggest in Goa and one of the best in the world. This is Sé Catedral de Santa Catarina, also called Se Cathedral, where ‘Se’ means ‘See’ in Portuguese. This is the cathedral of the Latin Church Archdiocese of Goa and Daman and a part of the World Heritage Site, Churches and convents of Goa.

At Se Cathedral, you will witness an opulence unlike anything you have seen before. Standing as a grand testament to the Portuguese legacy in the region, this 16th century church was built as a symbol of victory of the Portuguese over the Muslim army. It is the largest church in Asia, bigger than any church in Portugal itself, with an imposing façade, crafted in the ornate Portuguese-Manueline style and adorned with intricate carvings and statues that speak volumes of the craftsmanship.

The church is really long, 250 feet from end to end, and it's pretty wide too, at 181 feet. The front of the church is super tall, standing at 115 feet high.

SHRI-SHANTA-DURGA-TEMPLE
What's in a name
Snuggled into the arms of the verdant greens and tranquillity of Ponda, Goa sits the Shanta Durga Temple like a beacon of peace and spiritual solace. The very essence of the Goddess lies enshrined within her name. Dating back to the 18th century, this sacred sanctuary was dedicated to the revered Goddess Shree Durga, celebrated for her serene and composed demeanor.

The focal point of devotion is the resplendent idol of Shree Durga, gracefully adorned and radiating divine grace. Flanked by the formidable presence of Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu, locked in eternal conflict, the Goddess assumes the role of a divine mediator, seeking to reconcile their differences and restore harmony to the cosmos. This captivating portrayal symbolizes the Goddess's unwavering commitment to peace and her eternal quest for balance amidst chaos.

Many believe that the Goddess was first installed in the small cosy village of Cavelossim in Salcette but was later relocated to its current site in Kavalem. The shift came after the Portuguese plundered and destroyed historical monuments and temples to construct churches and propagate the teachings of Christianity. With each visit to the Shanta Durga Temple, devotees are drawn into a timeless journey of faith and introspection, guided by the luminous presence of the Goddess and the sanctity of her sacred abode.

Its graceful facade, adorned with intricate carvings and elegant arches, captivates the eye and soul alike. Dating back to the 16th century, this historic church bears witness to Goa's rich colonial heritage, its whitewashed walls whispering tales of bygone eras.

FORT-AGUADA
Mighty and Marvellous
You have heard of the beaches of Goa, the scintillating nightlife, the cute cafes, and the diverse cuisines. But your Goan experience would be incomplete without a trip to Fort Aguada. On the beach south of Candolim, by the Mandovi River, it was built in 1612 to protect against the Dutch and help guide ships from Europe. There's a spring inside that gave it its name, ‘Aguada’, which means watery in Portuguese. Ships stopped here for freshwater.

Fort Aguada, 18 kilometers away from the main city of Panjim, welcomes tourists and refreshes their minds with a far-flung view of the sea and speckles of the villages surrounding it. The sea is an astounding visual treat today, but back in the day, the area was prone to invasion. The Portuguese were aware of this disadvantage and hence designed an intricate defense system in the fort. The double walls and two gates are deliberate man-made strategies to track enemies and ensure their downfall before the rain of catastrophe.

A visit to this monument will feel like stepping into a time machine and traveling back to an era when wars for dominance, stunning architecture, and the beauty of nature coexisted to create a mesmerizing kaleidoscope of life.
