TAWANG-MONASTERY
The divine paradise of victory
Tawang Monastery is a magnificent example of Mahayana Buddhism and is the largest monastery in India. Nestled in the misty mountains of the eastern Himalayan range in Arunachal Pradesh, it was founded in the 17th century by Merak Lama Lodre Gyatso in accordance with the wishes of the 5th Dalai Lama. Also known as Gaden Namgyal Lhatse, which means "the divine paradise of complete victory," the monastery is situated at an elevation of over 10,000 feet and overlooks the picturesque Tawang Valley. The three-story high monastery is enclosed by a 925-foot (282 m) long compound wall and consists of 65 residential buildings. Its library houses valuable old scriptures, mainly Kangyur and Tengyur.
