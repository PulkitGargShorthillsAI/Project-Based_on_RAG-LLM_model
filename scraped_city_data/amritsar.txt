The heart of Gurudwara Bibeksar Sahib is the Bibeksar Sarovar, a sacred tank built by Guru Hargobind Sahib himself. This serene pool not only mirrors the beauty of its surroundings but also reflects the Guru's dedication to peace and community. The gurudwara, a magnificent display of architectural prowess, was later erected by Maharaja Ranjit Singh, adding another layer to its historical significance.

Amritsar, the spiritual heart of Sikhism, brims with historical and architectural treasures. Situated within the old city walls, near the Lohgarh Gate, lies Gurudwara Qila Lohgarh Sahib – a place that embodies the spirit of resilience and strength.

This revered Gurudwara stands as a testament to the pivotal role of Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji, the sixth Sikh Guru. Following the martyrdom of his father, Guru Arjan Dev Ji, Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji embarked on a mission to empower the Sikh community. As instructed by his father, he established a small fort at this very location, aptly named Lohgarh – meaning "iron fort."

This fort, now known as Gurudwara Qila Lohgarh Sahib, served as a training ground for a valiant army of Saint Soldiers. Driven by their faith and commitment to justice, these soldiers stood ready to defend their community against oppression.

Amritsar is a city that attracts millions of tourists throughout the year. In addition to the famous Golden Temple, the city is home to many beautiful places to visit. One such captivating site is the Gurudwara Chheharta Sahib, located in the village of Chheharta, about 7 km from Amritsar.

The revered 6th Sikh guru, Guru Hargobind Singh Ji, was born in this village. His father, Guru Arjan Dev named the Gurudwara after a large well was built to commemorate the birth of his successor. What's even more fascinating is that the well is surrounded by six Persian wheels that pull water more quickly, giving rise to its charming name, "Chehharta." Legend has it that these wheels hold the power to heal. It's an incredible sight to behold! Although the well is now covered, the water from the well is still being poured into the main tank of the Gurudwara and you can still observe the well-preserved Persian Wheels.

The Gurdwara is a breathtaking six-acre walled complex with a beautiful square sanctum at the heart of a diwan hall. It is crowned by a stunning lotus dome with a pinnacle coated in gold, adding to its majestic beauty.

JALLIANWALA-BAGH
Fallen like the brave. To rise for freedom
In the meandering lanes of Amritsar, neighbouring the resplendent Golden Temple, stands a haunting reminder of the price paid for India’s Independence, known as Jallianwala Bagh (garden of Jallianwala). This infamous garden is a memorial to all those who lost their lives in the open-fire orders given by General Dyer.

You will start seeing the unsettling signs when you enter through the narrow and the only entrance to the park and walk through. The walls, spotted with bullet marks and holes. The sculpted bushes, in the shape of armed soldiers are the reminders of the carnage that took place on the very soil years ago.

13 April 1919 – Women, children, and grandparents were out and about their usual routine in the park, some resting after their visit to the Golden Temple. A group of people were protesting silently about the Rowlatt Act (Black Act), which allowed the British Government to sentence any person to imprisonment without a trial. And then, without a whisper of a warning, the protestors were surrounded by their oppressors and left to die under a withering hail of bullets. The gunfire only halted when the soldiers nearly depleted their ammunition. Though the precise count of casualties remains a topic of debate, it is approximated that hundreds lost their lives, with over a thousand sustaining injuries.

After this massacre, Mahatma Gandhi declared, "The impossible men of India shall rise and liberate their motherland", and it truly, became a turning point in India's struggle for Independence.

She was known for her passionate kirtans that she sang every evening, leaving a lasting impact on the older Sikh community members. Born into a Muslim family as the daughter of the Qazi of Lahore, Bibi Kaulan’s devotion to Guru Hargobind Ji led her father to declare her an infidel and sentence her to death.

Goindwal is where Guru Amar Das first encountered Guru Ram Das. Legend has it that Goinda, a Marvaha Khatri trader, planned to establish a village at the western end of the Beas River ferry but was foiled by natural calamities. He sought the help of Guru Angad Singh and asked if one of his sons would come and settle there to reassure the people. The Guru agreed to help Goinda but none of the Guru's sons agreed to this proposal so the Guru asked his devoted disciple, Bhai Amar Das (he would later become the guru), to help Goinda.

MAHARAJA-RANJIT-SINGH-MUSEUM
A summer palace turned museum
In the 19th century, Maharaja Ranjit Singh emerged as a towering figure in the governance of the northwest Indian subcontinent, wielding considerable influence as the first Maharaja of the Sikh empire. Revered as the 'Lion of Punjab,' Maharaja Ranjit Singh carved out a formidable kingdom. Under his visionary leadership, Punjab witnessed sweeping reforms, modernisations, and a spirit of inclusivity that welcomed everyone alike. 

As the East India Company extended its dominion over vast swathes of India, Punjab remained one of the few regions beyond its grasp. Maharaja Ranjit Singh, recognising the importance of sovereignty, became the first monarch in the province to assert the flag of independence, symbolising Punjab's defiance against colonial rule.

Today, in the heart of Amritsar, just a short distance from the Golden Temple, a fantastic tribute to this great leader is in the form of a museum.

PUL-KANJARI
The village that was once a royal town
Near the Wagah Border, on the outskirts of Amritsar, lies a hidden gem. Steeped in history and folklore, this quaint village holds immense significance in the region's cultural tapestry.

Welcome to Pul Kanjari, a village established by Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the legendary Sikh ruler. It bears witness to a fascinating tale of love and devotion between a Sikh king and a Muslim girl.

Sounds like a plot from a Bollywood film, doesn't it? You'd be surprised to know it is not. It is the tale of Maharaja Ranjit Singh and Moran, a nautch dancer from the nearby village of Makhanpura, who used to perform in his royal court and later got married into his royal household.
The very name, 'Pul Kanjari', encapsulates a rich narrative: 'pul' means the bridge that was commissioned by Maharaja Ranjit Singh for Moran's ease of passage across canals, while 'Kanjari' was used to address dancers in those days. Historians contend that post her union with the Maharaja, Moran warranted a more dignified appellation, hence 'Pul Moran'.

In essence, Pul Moran (Pul Kanjari) not only chronicles a tale of love but also reverberates with themes of honour and respect, weaving together a narrative that celebrates both passion and pride.



ATTARI-WAGAH-BORDER
A different kind of India vs Pakistan
Welcome to the Attari-Wagah Border between India and Pakistan−easily the most famous border crossing between any two countries in the world. Once a symbol of longstanding rivalry, it is a beacon of hope, cooperation, and fraternity today.

No visit to Amritsar is complete without witnessing the 'lowering of the flags' ceremony in the evening. Dubbed 'Beating the Retreat', this ritual is impeccably executed by India's Border Security Force (BSF) and the Pakistan Rangers.

As the sun begins its descent, the ceremony commences with a spirited parade by the Indian and Pakistani soldiers, culminating in the synchronised lowering of the national flags. You can almost taste the charged atmosphere, the fierce pride in the air, the fervour rising, and the loud cheering from both sides! Positioned at attention on either side of the gate, a lone infantryman symbolises unity amid division. As dusk falls, the iron gates part and the flags gracefully descend in unison. Following the folding of the flags, a brief exchange of handshakes between soldiers signals the ceremony's conclusion, marked by the gates' closure. At dusk, the lights are switched on, marking the end of the day amidst thunderous applause.

Beyond the spectacle lies a deeper narrative of shared heritage and brotherhood. Despite the historical rivalry, these moments of camaraderie touch your soul. A tradition of exchanging sweets and greetings on auspicious occasions like Bakr-Eid, Diwali, and Independence Days reflects the spirit of kinship that transcends political boundaries.

PARTITION-MUSEUM
A memory that still haunts
The legacy of the partition of India continues to cast a long shadow over generations, both young and old, whether directly impacted or not. Delving into this sad chapter of India's history is painful, but if you are driven to understand, the Partition Museum is an indispensable destination.

Located in Amritsar's town hall, once the British headquarters and a jail, the museum opened its doors to the public on August 25th, 2017. At its core, the Partition Museum is a pivotal hub, offering a comprehensive narrative of one of the most tumultuous events in South Asian history. From the pre-partition era to the independence movement and the eventual division of the country, the museum traces the trajectory of partition and its aftermath. As a people's museum, it strives to portray the human experience with a significant collection of artefacts donated by survivors and their families. These items, from practical belongings to cherished mementoes, are poignant reminders of the losses and hardships endured during that time.

Art also plays a significant role in capturing the emotions and trauma of partition. Renowned artists like Krishen Khanna, Satish Gujral, and S.L. Parasher depicted the horrors of partition through their works, reflecting the anguish and upheaval of the era. The museum houses limited edition reprints of their paintings, offering visitors a glimpse into the artistic response to this historic event.

Through multimedia exhibits and over 100 oral interviews, the museum sheds light on crucial events such as the anti-colonial movement, the tragic Jallianwala Bagh massacre, the poignant Komagata Maru incident, and the divergent paths forged by the All India Muslim League and the Indian National Congress, while giving voice to those whose stories have often been sidelined in mainstream narratives. Its ongoing efforts to collect oral histories, documents, and footage aim to create a comprehensive repository of Partition stories, ensuring that this pivotal historical moment is never forgotten.
