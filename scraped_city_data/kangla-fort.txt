KANGLA-FORT
The throne of manipuri sovereignty
In the rich tapestry of Manipur's history, Kangla takes centre stage as the birthplace of the Manipur kingdom. Over time, it evolved into a formidable fortress, which came to be known as the Kangla Fort - a bastion of both political prowess and religious reverence.

Perched at a height of 394 meters, Kangla Fort is the heart of Manipur's storied past. Once the royal abode of the Meitei Dynasty until 1891, this historic stronghold bears witness to nearly two millennia of Manipuri legacy, dating back to the reign of King Pakhangba in 33 AD. Despite facing the trials of British and Assam Rifles conquests, Kangla Fort remains steadfast, echoing the whispers of its regal ancestry.

For those drawn to the cultural allure of Manipur, Hijagang awaits as a testament to the seafaring traditions of the Meitei people, where each traditional watercraft on display embodies the enduring spirit of Manipur's prowess. The Kangla Fort also houses several unmissable stopping points such as the Pakhangba Temple, the inner and outer moats, Kangla Museum and the royal residence and offices of former monarchs.
