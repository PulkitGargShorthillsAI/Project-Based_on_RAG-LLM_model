PATNA
Where timeless heritage meets vibrant culture
In the heart of Bihar, where ancient whispers still echo through the streets, lies a city that has watched the world change for over two millennia. Once the jewel of the Maurya and Gupta empires, Pataliputra stood proudly, its name synonymous with grandeur across the great cities of Asia. Now known as Patna, it’s a tapestry of time where history and modernity intertwine along the sacred Ganges.

West Patna, with its British colonial legacy, boasts stately mansions and solemn administrative edifices, standing as silent sentinels to a bygone era of order and elegance. Venture east and you’ll find yourself in the old city’s embrace—a labyrinth of narrow lanes, where every turn reveals a piece of history, from medieval monuments to the vibrant chaos of the bazaars, alive with the spirit of centuries.

This city, a living museum, breathes the legacy of empires while pulsing to the rhythm of contemporary life—a place where the past is not just remembered, but relived every day. The capital of Bihar is a modern city with ancient roots going back to 600 BC. During the reign of the Maurya and Gupta empires, then known as Pataliputra, was renowned as one of the great cities of Asia, but today it is a congested urban sprawl, stretching along the banks of the Ganges. West Patna, laid out by the British, has gracious mansions and administrative buildings, while the eastern end comprises the old city, a warren of crowded lanes surrounding medieval monuments and bustling bazaars.

AGAM-KUAN
The well of hell
Deep within the historic grounds of Patna, an ancient well stands vigil over ages long lost to the sands of time. Known as the Agam Kuan, this ancient reservoir carries echoes of a dark and tumultuous past etched into its very stones.

Dating back an astonishing 2200 years, the well's forbidding presence looms near the historic Kumhrar archaeological site, transporting you to the time of Emperor Ashoka's brutal reign before he embraced Buddhism. As sunlight filters through the gnarled trees surrounding the well, you can almost envision the grisly scenes that once unfolded in its shadowed depths.

The name Agam Kuan translates to "unfathomable well," which comes from a legend that Ashoka had tried emptying the well, but even after repeated attempts, the well couldn't be emptied, hinting at its fathomless depths, hence the name.

But this is just one of the many legends the storied well is mired in.

According to a myth, the well has a subterranean link with the Patala (netherworld) or hell; this was inferred on the basis that a saint found a heavy log in the well which was supposed to have been lost in the sea. This belief was further reinforced by the fact that fire used to emanate from the well, which was also called the ‘fiery well’ or ‘hell on earth’. Emperor Ashoka knew about it and turned this into his chambers of torture, where offenders were thrown into a fiery abyss. It is even said that Ashoka used the well to dispose of his 99 brothers to secure his claim to the Mauryan empire's throne.
