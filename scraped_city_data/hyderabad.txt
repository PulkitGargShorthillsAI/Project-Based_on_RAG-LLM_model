Spanning realms from the Middle East, Europe, and the Far East, the Salar Jung Museum has a collection of over 46,000 art objects, over 8,000 manuscripts and over 60,000 printed books, ranging from 2nd century B.C to early 20th century A.D.

MRUGAVANI-NATIONAL-PARK
A fascinating realm of wilderness
Your Hyderabad itinerary will bring you up close and personal with some of India's most stunning historical and spiritual wonders. But a little distance away, enroute to Chilkuru in Moinabad, the scenery changes, and you will find yourself in a verdant sanctuary called Mrugavani National Park - a haven for nature enthusiasts and wildlife lovers alike.

Curious name, you would be thinking. This intriguing name comes from the Telugu words "Mrugu" (meaning deer) and "Vani" (meaning forest). Because in its incredible tapestry of flora and fauna, the deer reign supreme. This 'forest of deer' is home to an incredible 350 spotted deer, including the majestic Indian blackbuck, the graceful spotted deer, and the elusive barking deer.

But of course, graceful deer aside, you will find over 600 species of plants and animals like the Cheetal, Sambar, Wild boar, Jungle Cat, Civet Cat, Mongoose, Monitor Lizard, Python, Russell Viper, and more. The park also boasts more than 100 species of birds, including warblers, peacocks, lapwings, and flowerpeckers, making it an ideal destination for birdwatchers.

The reason why there is such a dense variety of animals and plants is that in 1994, this place was declared a wildlife sanctuary by the Indian government to preserve nature and wildlife, giving them a great environment to flourish.

The best way to enjoy it is to go on a guided wildlife safari, which will take you into the heart of the park to witness the wild residents' natural habitats. Alternatively, you can go to the points in the park, which offer great views. There's also a watch tower, which will help you get great clicks, especially when you're birdwatching!

But the adventure is just beginning.



ST-MARYS-CHURCH
A grand cathedral built during the Nizam’s reign
St. Mary's Church, or the Basilica of Our Lady of the Assumption, is the oldest Roman Catholic church in the city. While it served as the principal Church of the Vicariate of Hyderabad, it was formerly known as St. Mary’s Cathedral. It is located on Sarojini Naidu Road in Secunderabad, near Hyderabad.

|The church has an intriguing history. In 1839, Father Daniel Murphy began searching for a location to build a church in Hyderabad, the capital of the Nizam kingdom. Back then, no religion, other than Islam, was looked upon kindly. As a result, he considered Secunderabad as an alternative site. St. Mary's Church took a decade to reach completion in 1850. At that time, it proudly held the distinction of being the largest church in the state.

Today, it bears the esteemed title of a minor basilica. The church continues with regular masses, creating a spiritual atmosphere of reverence. Mark your calendar for mid-August, when St. Mary's Church celebrates the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary. This joyous occasion welcomes all visitors from near and far to partake in the spirit of devotion. The church is a delight to see on Christmas when the entire area is lit with colourful lights.
