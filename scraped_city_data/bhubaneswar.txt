Like many other temples in Odisha, the Ananta Vasudeva Temple is a sight to behold.

Where Shaivism and Vaishnavism converge
Lingaraj Temple was called “The finest example of Hindu temples in India" by the historian James Fergusson. It is one of the oldest and most revered temples in Odisha.

Commissioned in the 11th century by King Jajati Keshari of the Somvanshi dynasty, this sacred site enshrines a Swayambhu (self-manifested) Shivalinga, measuring 8 feet in diameter and 8 inches in height. Yet, legends suggest that the Shivalinga within the temple was being worshipped as early as the 7th century.

While access to the temple is restricted to Hindus, non-Hindu visitors can still admire the entire temple complex and capture its splendour from a designated elevated platform.

Inside, the hallowed corridors are adorned with vivid depictions from Hindu mythology narrating the intriguing tales of gods and goddesses.

Annually, crowds of pilgrims converge here to seek blessings and divine favour from Lord Shiva, particularly during revered festivals like Mahashivratri and Ashokastami, celebrated with fervour within the temple precincts.
