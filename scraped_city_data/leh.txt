LEH
A timeless journey into nature’s majesty
In the heart of the Himalayas, where the air thins and the mountains touch the sky, lies Leh — a canvas painted by the gods themselves. Let's wander through this high-altitude desert, where whispers echo across barren valleys and prayer flags flutter like forgotten dreams.

The place wears its ruggedness like a badge of honour. The land stretches, sinewy and unyielding as if it defied time itself. The sun, relentlessly, kisses the earth, leaving behind salted scars. But look closer — between the cracks, life persists. Tiny succulents cling to existence, their roots digging deep into ancient soil. It is a dance of survival, choreographed by wind and solitude. In this beautiful chaos, Ladakh's villages emerge like mirages where their poplar trees sway and their apricot orchards blush. The villagers — stoic yet warm — till the land, their hands calloused by generations of labour. Water, precious as stardust, flows through narrow channels, nurturing life. And when the moon rises, the village square becomes a theatre — a place for stories, laughter, and chai.

Cloudless skies stretch overhead — a cerulean expanse that defies gravity. The sun, unfiltered, paints everything in sharp relief. Shadows elongate, and the mountains — those ancient sentinels — reveal their secrets. The air, thin as a whisper, carries prayers to the heavens. And when night falls, the stars — diamonds scattered by cosmic hands — ignite the darkness.

GURUDWARA-PATHAR-SAHIB
The stone that became like wax
As you travel along the picturesque Leh-Kargil Road in Ladakh, you will come across a beautiful Gurudwara built in memory of Guru Nanak Dev – the founder of Sikhism.

Welcome to the Gurudwara Pathar Sahib, an iconic gurudwara situated at an altitude of 12,000 feet. The gurudwara is named after a 'pathar', a boulder central to its legendary origins. In the late 1970s, a boulder was discovered during the construction of the Leh-Nimu road, which is believed to have the imprint of Guru Nanak.

When the construction workers failed to remove this boulder, they were told of the legend associated with Guru Nanak Dev’s visit to the Ladakh region in 1517. It is said that after travelling across Sikkim, Nepal, Tibet, and Yarkand, Guru Nanak Dev sought refuge near Leh on his return journey. 

His presence relieved the people, who were afraid of a terrifying demon that lived on the opposite hill. This demon became very angry at Guruji's presence and hurled a boulder at his back to kill him. However, when the boulder touched Guruji's body, it became soft like wax and stuck to his body instead of hurting him. Enraged, he attempted to shove the boulder with his right foot, only to find that the stone, still as malleable as warm wax, ensnared his foot within its grasp. Upon wrenching his foot free from the boulder, the demon stood in disbelief at the imprint his foot had left behind, etched into the solid rock.

To commemorate this event, the Indian Army, along with the help of local people, constructed the Gurudwara Pathar Sahib around the miraculous boulder. The local Lamas consider the boulder sacred and offer prayers to this day.

Fascinatingly, all cars passing this route make sure to stop and pray to seek blessings. And every Sunday, officers from the Indian Army volunteer here for public service.
