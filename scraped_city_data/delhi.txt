DELHI
A city of beautiful contrasts
Delhi, India's vibrant capital, is a world within itself. With its kaleidoscope of scents, sounds, and sights, Delhi never fails to captivate. From its rich history and architectural marvels to its delectable cuisine and vibrant nightlife, the city offers an unforgettable experience.

One of the world's oldest continuously inhabited cities, Delhi’s roots date back to the era of the ancient Mahabharata, when the city was known as Indraprastha, the legendary home of the Pandavas. Since then, the city has seen empires rise and fall, from the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughals, who left behind architectural marvels, to the British, who shaped parts of it.

While Delhi is a melting pot of varied cultures, what sets it apart is its diverse character. Here, you can experience the best of both worlds—the timeless elegance of a bygone era alongside the exhilarating energy of a modern megacity. On the one hand, you’ll find the vibrant chaos of narrow lanes, centuries-old monuments, and old-world charm. On the other, the city offers vast green spaces, modern buildings, swanky malls, and colonial-era architecture.



NATIONAL-WAR-MEMORIAL
For the love of the country
"When you go home, tell them of us, and tell that for their tomorrow, we gave our today."

These words, penned by John Maxwell Edmonds, encapsulate the profound sacrifice of soldiers who have laid down their lives for their nation. In the heart of New Delhi, adjacent to the iconic India Gate, stands a testament to this very spirit.

LODHI-GARDEN
A tranquil oasis of history and beauty
In the bustling heart of New Delhi, where the clamour of urban life often drowns out the whispers of history, lies a verdant sanctuary that defies time. This enchanting haven is none other than Lodhi Garden, a place where history breathes and nature thrives.

Lodhi Garden traces its roots to the 15th century when Lodhi lords chose it as their burial ground. The garden houses significant tombs, including those of Mohammed Shah and Sikandar Lodi. In 1936, during British colonial rule, Lady Willingdon redesigned the area as a landscaped setting for these ancient monuments, initially naming it Lady Willingdon Park.
Post-independence in 1947, it was renamed Lodhi Garden. The space underwent further transformation in 1968 under American landscape architect Garrett Eckbo and architect Joseph Allen Stein, who added a glass house, a fountain-adorned lake, and specialist sections like the bonsai park and rose garden, enhancing its appeal as a tranquil urban retreat that invites visitors to explore its intriguing past, relax amidst nature, and discover architectural marvels.



AGRASEN-KI-BAOLI
More than just a water reservoir
Baolis, or stepwells, hold a special place in India's architectural heritage. Beyond their practical function as water reservoirs, they served as social centres for gathering and gossip and a staging post for travellers in medieval times.

In the bustling heart of Delhi lies an architectural marvel steeped in history and legend — the enigmatic Agrasen ki Baoli. Nestled amidst the urban sprawl on Hailey Road, this 60 metres long and 15 metres wide ancient stepwell with 108 steps beckons the curious to delve into its depths and uncover its secrets.



HUMAYUNS-TOMB
A sight to behold!
Humayun's Tomb, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is more than just a mausoleum; it's a mesmerising monument whispered into existence by love. This architectural marvel, the first garden-tomb on the Indian subcontinent, holds the final resting place of Mughal Emperor Humayun.

Humayun's Tomb was a true architectural game-changer. This pioneering design served as a major inspiration for future architectural innovations, culminating in the breathtaking wonder—the Taj Mahal. It was also the first large-scale structure in Delhi to use red sandstone, a material that would become synonymous with Mughal grandeur.

Commissioned in 1558 by Empress Bega Begum, Humayun's first wife and chief consort, the tomb is a poignant testament to her love for her husband. Under her patronage, Persian architects, along with Indian craftsmen, designed the tomb, ensuring her beloved emperor would be laid to rest in a place of unparalleled beauty.

FEROZ-SHAH-KOTLA-FORT
A legacy of a water-wise king
Travel back in time at the Kotla Firoz Shah, a grand fort steeped in Delhi's rich history. Sultan Firoz Shah Tughlaq built this impressive fortress in the 14th century, making it one of the oldest structures in Delhi. This fort, known as 'Kotla', was the heart of Firozabad, the fifth city of Delhi, and was a result of the Sultan's vision. In response to a severe water shortage in the old city, Firoz Shah made a bold move. He abandoned the previous capitals and established Firozabad, strategically located on the banks of the Yamuna River. Kotla Firoz Shah, the city's citadel, is a testament to his innovative planning. It was here, for the first time, that a citadel was divided into dedicated functional areas, a concept that would be adopted by the mighty Mughals who followed.

Firoz Shah, known for his people-centric approach and commitment to conservation, left his mark on the landscape. During his reign, palaces, towns, bridges, and sarais (rest houses for travellers) were constructed. The Kotla Firoz Shah complex, affectionately called Feroz Shah Kotla Fort by locals, holds a treasure trove waiting to be explored. The towering Ashoka Pillar, intricately carved centuries ago, stands tall amidst the ruins. The Jami Masjid, a congregational mosque, and a baoli, a stepwell that provided vital water, offer a glimpse into the daily life of the city's residents. Sprawling gardens add a touch of serenity to the fort's grounds.

TUGHLAQABAD-FORT
A story of ambition and mystery
Standing tall amid the ruins, Tughlaqabad Fort is unlike other historical sites in the city of Delhi. This ancient marvel remains largely untouched, a massive, abandoned testament to a king's grand vision. This was the third historic city of Delhi, succeeding Lal Kot and Siri.

Tughlaqabad Fort was built by Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq, the founder of the Tughlaq Dynasty, in 1321. He wanted to create a new capital city that would showcase his power and also serve as a strong fortress. The fortifications were designed to be 25 meters high at some points to protect the city. It was equipped with granaries, water reservoirs, and hidden chambers for ammunition and treasures, making it self-sufficient. Legend has it that Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq proposed the idea of building a fortified city to Sultan Alauddin Khalji, who ridiculed the proposal. After becoming the Sultan himself, Ghiyasuddin pursued his dream. However, the construction of Tughlaqabad faced numerous challenges. It is said that Tughlaq even issued a decree requiring all workers in the Delhi Sultanate to contribute to its construction in his pursuit of this grand vision.

Despite its unfinished state, Tughlaqabad Fort offers a glimpse into a bygone era. Walk through the massive walls, explore the remnants of palaces, and imagine the grand city that might have been.

PURANA-QUILA
A legacy of two emperors
Imagine a fort built on a site teeming with life since 1000 BC! That’s the Purana Qila (or Old Fort), one of Delhi's most fascinating forts. This 16th-century marvel served as the inner citadel of Dinpanah, the sixth city of Delhi.

Archaeological finds hint at a long history of habitation here. While the Mughal emperor Humayun laid its foundations, it is believed he was constructing upon the legendary city of Indraprastha, the epic kingdom of the Mahabharata. Until the early 1900s, the fort was even called ‘Pandavon Ka Qila’ (Fort of the Pandavas)!

However, Humayun's grand vision was interrupted when the Afghan ruler, Sher Shah Suri, seized power. Sher Shah refortified and expanded the structure, even renaming it Shergarh. But, Humayun's story wasn't over. He returned to India 15 years later, reclaimed the fort, and restored its original name, Dinpanah. Today, Purana Qila stands as a testament to both emperors' contributions. Situated on Mathura Road close to Pragati Maidan, this historic landmark isn't just a testament to the past; it's also a favourite spot for locals to relax and enjoy a picnic.

A regal palace that turned into a revered religious site

The origin story of Gurudwara Bangla Sahib begins with Jaisinghpura Palace, a lavish residence built by a Rajput king, Raja Jai Singh. In 1664, the eighth Sikh Guru, Sri Guru Har Krishan Ji visited Delhi and resided at this very palace. Tragedy struck the city as a deadly outbreak of smallpox and cholera ravaged the people. Guru Har Krishan Ji responded by offering aid to the suffering and provided fresh water from the well located in the palace. Years later, in 1783, Sikh General Sardar Baghel Singh built a small shrine on the very spot where the palace once stood. This shrine, forever linked to Sri Guru Har Krishan Ji's act of service, eventually blossomed into the majestic Gurudwara Bangla Sahib.

Today, with its gleaming white marble edifice and golden domes, the Gurudwara Bangla Sahib stands as a symbol of spiritual solace. Its sacred waters, believed to possess healing properties, continue to draw devotees and tourists alike, offering a moment of reflection and peace in the pulsating heart of India's capital.
