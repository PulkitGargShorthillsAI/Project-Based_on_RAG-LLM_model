GUWAHATI
Guwahati: From betel nut trails to urban tales
Close your eyes and step into Guwahati—a city that wears its history like a silken sari. Let's wander through this gateway to Northeast India, where gods dance, tea leaves unfurl, and betel nuts sway.

The capital of Assam, Dispur, lies in Guwahati city, which is also the gateway to Northeast India.

Ringed by the Nilachal Hills, the city stretches along both banks of the broad Brahmaputra river -the mighty river - binds Guwahati's twin souls. On one bank, the old city—its lanes like ancient manuscripts, its temples like folded hands. On the other, the new city—its glass towers reaching for the sky, its dreams as vast as the river's expanse. Bridges connect past and future—the Saraighat Bridge, the Bhupen Hazarika Setu—they're more than concrete; they're arteries.

An ancient seat of tantric Hinduism, with several interesting temples in its environs, Guwahati's air carries the scent of tea gardens. Assam's golden brew—steeped in mist and monsoons—flows through its veins. The tea auctions hum, traders sipping chai as they bid for leaves that cradle stories. And oil—black gold—courses through pipelines, its journey mirroring the Brahmaputra's twists. The city's heartbeat syncs with the rhythm of commerce. This is how Guwahati is now a busy commercial centre for Assam’s tea and oil industries.

Now, let's talk about the betel nut trees—the graceful dancers of Guwahati's fringes. They sway, their emerald leaves catching the sunlight. Betel nuts—small, potent, and wrapped in paan—hold conversations in every market. The vendors, their teeth-stained crimson, hawk their wares. "Betel leaves, sir? A taste of Guwahati!" they call. And if you listen closely, you'll hear the trees whispering: "We've seen empires rise and fall. We've watched lovers meet and part. We're the heartbeat of this market." The city’s outer fringes are dotted with the slender, graceful betelnut palm trees from which Guwahati (literally “Betel Nut Market”) derives its name.



JANARDANA-TEMPLE
An amazing amalgamation of cultures
Temples and deities have always left an imprint on our culture and society. Old or new the celebration of Gods has never stopped in our nation from older to newer times. Another celebration of Gods is held at the Shukleshwar hillock near the beautiful Shukleshwar Ghat, which is located along the Brahmaputra River, flowing from Tibet to the Bay of Bengal. This is none other than the Janardana Temple in Guwahati.

Located on a hillock, this temple is no ordinary temple, with Buddha as the main deity located in the centre, the legend of this temple is immensely popular. The belief that Buddha is the reincarnation of Lord Vishnu creates a beautiful blend of Buddhist and Hindu cultures. This reflects the idea that the gods are similar and lead us all to the path of enlightenment. This Buddhist reincarnation of Lord Vishnu is known as Janardana, from which the name of the temple is also derived.

The temple's existence is said to be very old while it's believed that it was renovated in the 17th century by Swargdev Paramatt Singh, making it one of the most exceptional temples in the state of Assam.



GANDHI-MANDAP
Steeped in culture
The largest city in the state of Assam, Guwahati, previously known as Gauhati, is situated on the banks of the Brahmaputra River, making it a major riverine port city. Also known as the “Gateway to North East India”, this city is filled with wonders. As one of the largest producers and importers of tea in the world, it is also home to many stunning ancient Hindu temples, earning the name “The City of Temples.” The history of this city dates back to the bygone era of the 10th century when it was considered the capital of the Hindu kingdom of Kama Rupa (under the name of Pragjyotisa). In those days, the Kamrup region, where present-day Guwahati is located, was inhabited by the Kirati people. You would be surprised to know that the area of Guwahati city can be divided into four areas, namely ancient, medieval, colonial and post-colonial which show how historically rich the city is.



POBITORA-WILDLIFE-SANCTUARY
A sanctuary of wonders awaits
Situated just 56 km from Guwahati lies a wildlife paradise waiting to be explored by enthusiasts and nature lovers alike. Welcome to the enchanting Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary, boasting of the country's highest density of the Greater One Horned Rhinoceros – even more than the famed Kaziranga National Park! Once teetering on the brink of extinction, these magnificent creatures now thrive in this sanctuary, a testament to the triumph of conservation efforts.

As you delve into the heart of the sanctuary, you'll find yourself immersed in a vibrant tapestry of life.

From the melodious calls of exotic birds to the stealthy movements of elusive reptiles, every corner of the sanctuary pulsates with the rhythm of nature's symphony.



GUWAHATI-WAR-CEMETERY
The pride and heartache
A cemetery for some people is considered just a resting place for the dead but for others, the cemetery is associated with their lives. One such cemetery that speaks of past and heartache alike is the Guwahati War Cemetery in the Guwahati city of Assam. This cemetery started during the Second World War. Buried here are the bodies of people from several military hospitals near the vicinity. These hospitals were treating the soldiers who were wounded in the war, and those who died were sent to the cemetery to be buried.

But as time progressed, the deaths increased and the place for them to be buried decreased. Thus, the Army Graves Service bought graves from the other cemetery namely, Amari Bari Military Cemetery, Guwahati Civil Cemetery, Sylhet Military Cemetery and many more. This was done to provide a final resting place for the dead who couldn't find a permanent place to be buried. As deaths increased even further, in 1952 they had to buy several places nearby to accommodate. Today, this cemetery has 521 graves which include 316 Commonwealth servicemen of the Second World War, 136 known and seven unknown Indian soldiers, 5 foreign soldiers, 2 whose nationality is unknown and 24 graves of Chinese army soldiers.

Among the 9 World War cemeteries in India, Guwahati was the only cemetery to have 11 Japanese soldiers buried there. Still, later they were dug up and taken by the Japanese government to give them burials of honour in their native country. 

The Guwahati war cemetery is not only a cemetery but is also the pride of the country. It is also a reminder of the heavy price they had to pay for war and the debt we owe to them all. The cemetery is a testament to their bravery and devotion towards the country.



NAVAGRAHA-TEMPLE
Take the blessings of the planets
Amidst the gentle whispers of the wind and the spellbinding panorama of nature, atop the Chitrasal Hill in Guwahati, lies an enchanting place visited by wanderers and devotees who seek divine blessings from the heavens.

Welcome to the Navagraha Temple, a temple where celestial bodies are worshipped instead of deities. The word ‘Navagraha’ (‘Nava’ meaning nine and ‘Graha’ meaning planet) refers to the nine celestial bodies whose positions at the time of one’s birth determine their destiny and influences their lives. The temple traces its origins to the reign of the Ahom King Rajeswar Singha in the 18th century. Despite enduring partial destruction in the wake of a formidable earthquake in 1897, the temple underwent meticulous restoration efforts, including the innovative use of corrugated iron sheets for roofing.

A sacred sanctuary of devotion, the Navagraha Temple beckons faithful pilgrims seeking solace and divine intervention amidst the cosmic dance of planetary influences. Adorned with offerings of prayers, fragrant blooms, succulent fruits, and flickering oil lamps, the temple's Shivalingas bear witness to the supplications of its visitors. Rituals such as the revered Navagraha Puja, Homa, and Shanti ceremonies unfold within its hallowed halls, invoking celestial blessings and appeasing cosmic forces.

Upon a mythical mountain
Not far from the bustling city of Guwahati, nestled amidst the tranquil embrace of the mighty Brahmaputra River, lies a hidden gem waiting to be discovered.

To reach this holy sanctuary, you can take a boat ride from the banks of the Brahmaputra. You can even admire the stunning view of the riverfront from the jetty while waiting for the boat to pick you up.

The origins of this sacred site trace back to a divine encounter between Lord Shiva and Lord Kamadeva. As the legend goes, while Lord Shiva was engrossed in meditation on the island, Lord Kamadeva dared to disrupt his penance, provoking the ire of the mighty deity. In his wrath, Lord Shiva reduced Lord Kamadeva to ashes, giving rise to the sacred Bhasmacala mountain upon which the Umananda Temple now stands.

Established by the illustrious King Gadadhar of the Ahom dynasty, the Umananda Temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva. To reach the temple, pilgrims must ascend the steep steps that lead to its hallowed grounds.
