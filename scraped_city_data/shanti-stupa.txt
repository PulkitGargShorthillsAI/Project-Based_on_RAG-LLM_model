SHANTI-STUPA
A breathtaking spiritual landmark
Atop the Chanspa hill that overlooks the picturesque Ladakh Valley is Shanti Stupa, a stunning white domed monument rising against the freezing blue sky, which is a symbol of world peace.

Perched above the town of Leh, this beautiful stupa draws thousands of tourists and devotees because of its religious significance and the views it offers.

The idea behind constructing this grand building dates back to Nichidatsu Fujii, also known as Fuji Guruji. He first imagined the idea in 1914 to commemorate 2500 years of Buddhism. He worked with Tibetan and Japanese monks and the respected Kushok Bakula, the Lama of Ladakh, to bring this vision of harmony to life with great care and attention to detail.

The stupa was built in 1991 under the guidance of Bhikshu Gyomyo Nakamura, a revered Buddhist Bhikshu from Japan, culminating with its grand unveiling by Tenzin Gyatso, the Dalai Lama.Â 

You need to climb 500 steps to reach this place, but once you do, you're in for a visual treat, for suddenly, the stunning vistas of Leh's beautiful township and the majestic peaks of the Himalayas materialise before you.
