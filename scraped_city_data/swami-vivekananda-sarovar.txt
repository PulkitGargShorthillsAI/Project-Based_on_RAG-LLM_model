Imagine a tranquil lake surrounded by lush greenery, right in the midst of the bustling city. It's like stumbling upon a serene oasis amidst the urban chaos. This place isn't just a pretty sight; it's a tribute to Swami Vivekananda, featuring a towering 37-foot statue of the revered Indian philosopher and spiritual leader.
