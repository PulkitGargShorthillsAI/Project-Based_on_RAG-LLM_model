IMPHAL
A Mystical Wonder
In the heart of India’s northeastern tapestry lies a secret veiled by mist and cradled by hills. It is Imphal, where time tiptoes, and the air tastes of dew-kissed dreams. In this uncharted wonderland, lushness spills from every crevice. The hills are draped in velvet, the valleys blushing with wildflowers, and the orchids nod in approval, their petals like delicate promises. The Sangai, a rare dancing deer, pirouettes in Keibul Lamjao National Park. Its hooves barely touch the ground—it is a creature caught between earth and ether. And the birds! Oh, they’re maestros. Sunbirds sip nectar from flame-of-the-forest blossoms, while hornbills play hide-and-seek in ancient trees. Their calls echo through the mist, composing symphonies.

As you enter Imphal, the air feels cleaner, and the surroundings more serene, with the landscapes characterized by picturesque valleys, rolling hills, and a diverse array of flora and fauna. If you stroll through Kangla Fort—the ancient citadel where Manipur’s kings once held court, nature choreographs its ballet, the butterflies flit, and the Brahmaputra River hums a lullaby. Situated in the heart of the city, it is a symbol of Manipur's rich history and heritage. It has been a site of political and religious significance since the 1st century AD.

A walk offers a glimpse into the past, with its ancient temples, ceremonial halls, and the regal Kangla Sha, a statue that pays homage to the state animal, the Sangai deer. The fort's serene atmosphere and historical significance make it a must-visit for history buffs and casual tourists alike. Once the seat of Manipur's kingdom, the fort's remnants, including its ancient temples and bastions, speak volumes of its past glory.



MANIPUR-ZOOLOGICAL-GARDEN
Home to the world's only dancing deer species
Imagine the kind of flora and fauna that must be in a place nicknamed the 'Jewel Box' of Manipur.

This magical place is the Manipur Zoological Garden, which lies at the foothills of the pine-clad Iroisemba Hillocks along the Imphal-Kangchup Road.

The Manipur Zoological Garden is home to an incredible collection of wildlife. Amidst the rustle of leaves and whispers of nature, a veritable treasure trove of rare species exists. We are talking about a place with over 400 animal and bird species, including the rare Himalayan bear, the elegant Thamin, the elusive Slow Loris, the playful Hoolock Gibbon, and over 55 avian wonders, like the Nongin, that are spectacular to watch.

But keep your eyes peeled for one of the rarest and most endangered species on Earth. If you're lucky, you might just encounter the elegant, brow-antlered deer known locally as Sangai, which is also the world's only dancing deer species!



SHRI-GOPINATH-TEMPLE
Exploring a milestone of Vaishnavi Hinduism
Amidst the verdant landscapes of Imphal, in the city of Manipur, lies the illustrious Gopinath Temple. Commissioned in the year 1905 by the Maharaja of the era, this architectural marvel is one of the largest and most revered temples in Manipur.

Steeped in legend and infused with divine grace, the origins of the Gopinath Temple trace back to a profound tale of royal benevolence. Legend has it that the Gopinath temple was a gift to the state from the Maharaja of Manipur. The idol of Shri Gopinath was crafted from the heart of a mighty tree trunk and bears witness to the reign of Maharaja Karta. As fate would have it, during a war, the king encountered Keshori, a tribal woman from Ningthoukhong. Their bond blossomed into marriage, and from their union, Prince Puraraj emerged. Under his tender care, the sacred idol found its home first in Konung Leikai, Kwasiphai, and then in Ningthoukhong, where it remains the object of devout worship to this day.
Each year, over ten lakh worshippers, travellers, and seekers of spiritual solace converge upon the hallowed grounds of the Shri Gopinath Temple, drawn by its aura of divine sanctity and historical significance. Whether seeking divine blessings or revelling in the joyous festivities of Holi, Diwali, Janmashtami, or Durga Puja, visitors are enraptured by the temple's ethereal beauty and vibrant spiritual atmosphere.
