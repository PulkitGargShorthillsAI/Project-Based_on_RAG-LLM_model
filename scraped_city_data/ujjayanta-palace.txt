UJJAYANTA-PALACE
A palace that inspired one of India's greatest poets
Prepare to be swept away into a realm of grandeur as you set foot in the heart of Agartala, where the Ujjayanta Palace awaits. Spread over one sq. km, this palace was built by Maharaja Radha Kishore Manikya and stood proud amidst the bustling capital city. However, after Tripura became a state of India, the Tripura Government purchased the palace and it became the State Legislative Assembly.

Every corner of Ujjayanta Palace exudes an aura of regal splendour, from ornate courtyards to intricately carved pillars. The palace’s compound stretches across approximately 250 acres and boasts opulent public rooms such as the throne room, durbar hall, library, and reception hall. The lush garden is adorned with pools and fountains and flanked by two large artificial ponds, creating a serene and picturesque setting. Enveloping the heart of Agartala, the expansive grounds cover 800 acres, offering a grand and awe-inspiring sight to behold. 

Such was its timeless charm that it not only inspired Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore to name the palace but also to pen his renowned poem, "The Palace." As night falls, witness the palace come alive under the enchanting glow of floodlights while fountains dance to a symphony of light and water. Ujjayanta Palace beckons you to embark on a journey of wonder and delight, promising an experience that will linger in your memory.
