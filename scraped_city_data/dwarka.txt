DWARKA
Behold Dwarka: The gateway to heaven
In the embrace of the boundless Arabian Sea, lies the ancient city of Dwarka, built by the divine hands of Lord Krishna himself. Here, amidst the ebb and flow of time, pilgrims find solace in its spirituality, for Dwarka is one of the four sacred Hindu pilgrimage sites called the Char Dham.

The very name, Dwarka, whispers of its celestial origin: 'Dwar,' the gate, 'ka,' the essence of Brahma, which translates to ‘gateway to heaven’ in Sanskrit. Truly, it stands as a sacred sanctum where mortals commune with the divine.

Legend has it that Lord Krishna asked ‘Samudra’, the ocean god, to give him 12 yojanas (or 96 square kilometres) of land from the sea. Lord Krishna, with the help of Vishwakarma, the craftsman of the gods, then shaped the city of Dwarka, turning it into his abode. However, when Lord Krishna departed the mortal realm, Dwarka and its people were swallowed by the ocean, and cast into the realm of legend.

It is this legend that makes Dwarka (also known as Devbhumi Dwarka) a crown jewel for Gujarat, because not only is it home to the stunning Dwarkadhish temple, it is also a marine archaeological marvel. Offshore excavations have revealed the remnants of an ancient city dating back to 2000 BC. Excavated relics, such as ancient stone anchors, offer compelling evidence of Dwarka’s pivotal role in the trade between India and Arabia from the 15th to the 18th centuries. Evidently, Dwarka was a significant trade port at that time, serving as a crucial gateway for foreign sailors venturing into India.

Come, let’s dive deeper into the ancient marvels of this extraordinary city.



GAYATRI-SHAKTIPEETH
A sanctuary of spiritual solace
Situated just 5 km away from Dwarka, the Gayatri Shaktipeeth stands as a sacred sanctuary that holds a significant place among the temples visited during a Dwarka pilgrimage. Established in 1983, it holds the distinction of being the only temple in Dwarka dedicated to Goddess Gayatri, revered as the Mother of all Vedas.

Devotees flock to this divine abode with deep reverence, seeking blessings from Maa Gayatri. It serves as a cherished gathering point during the Dham Yatra pilgrimage. The temple holds immense importance for Hindus due to its mythological beliefs and spiritual associations.

BEYT-DWARKA
A divine abode with many names
Amidst the glistening waters of the Arabian Sea lies the enchanting island of Beyt Dwarka (also spelled Bet Dwarka), a gem of the Indian subcontinent. Derived from the word ‘bet’ which translates to ‘gift’, this island is believed to have been the abode of Lord Krishna, and the place where he received a special gift from his friend Sudama. Another interesting name for this island is ‘Shankhodhar’ due to the island's 'shankh’ or conch shape. But there’s another legend behind the name, in which Lord Krishna lifted a conch shell from this very location to blow it during the epic Mahabharata war. Beyt Dwarka is even referred to as 'Antardvipa', in the Mahabharata, a destination that members of the Yadava clan had to access by boat.

Beyond its divine connection, Beyt Dwarka will captivate you with its natural beauty, boasting shimmering beaches, crystalline waters, and a thriving marine ecosystem. From exploring its rich history to watching the mesmerising sunset and more, every moment spent on this island is an unforgettable experience.



GOMTI-GHAT
The way to enlightenment
Along the banks of the revered Gomti river lies the Gomti Ghat, a hallowed place frequented by the devout. Considered a tributary of the Ganga, the Gomti river is believed to wash away sins, and hence, pilgrims come here to take a dip in its holy waters before proceeding to the renowned Dwarkadhish temple.
Along the ghat, you'll discover small shrines dedicated to revered deities such as Samudra (God of the Sea), Saraswati, and Lakshmi, where you can offer prayers and seek divine blessings. There are also shrines dedicated to Lord Shiva, Lord Rama, Lord Krishna, and Krishna's dear friend Sudama.

It is not just the shrines that make a visit to Gomti Ghat memorable; there are decorated camels to ride, busy tea stands, and charming local vendors selling seashell jewellery. For a unique perspective, you can also hire a boat on the Gomti to see Dwarka's panoramic beauty. Visit the ghat during the early morning or late afternoon, when it is relatively quiet, and the views of the Gomti and the surrounding area are at their best.

Superlatives fall short when you gaze upon this sacred sanctuary, for such is its beauty and divine energy. But some have tried, giving it the names Jagat Mandir (universal shrine) and even Trilok Sundar (the most beautiful in all three worlds).

Believed to have been established centuries ago by Lord Krishna's great-grandson Vajranabh, the temple is a sacred cornerstone of the revered Char Dham pilgrimage, alongside Rameswaram, Badrinath, and Puri. The hallowed grounds of this temple have seen not just devotees and travellers but revered saints and sages too. One such example is that of Adi Shankara, the revered Hindu theologian and philosopher, who is believed to have visited the shrine in the 8th century. To this day, a memorial within the temple stands as a tribute to his visit.



BHADKESHWAR-MAHADEV-TEMPLE

Dedicated to a form of Lord Shiva known as the Chandra-Mouliswar Shiva, this ancient sanctuary enshrines a sacred Shivalinga, which is believed to be Swayambhu or the self-manifested lingam of Lord Shiva.

It is said that over five thousand years ago, the deity revealed himself in the form of this revered Shivalinga in the sea. The temple was built at the confluence of Gomti, Ganga, and the Arabian Sea by the revered Jagadguru Adi Shankaracharya.

Renowned as one of Dwarka's most iconic Shiva temples, the Bhadkeshwar Mahadev Temple offers you not only spiritual fervour but also an unrivalled view of Dwarka's scenic coastline due to its elevated perch.
