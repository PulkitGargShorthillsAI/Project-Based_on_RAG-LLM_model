DWARKADHISH-TEMPLE
The legendary temple of Lord Krishna
In the holy city of Dwarka, there is one sacred name whose splendour transcends even mortal comprehension, leaving souls in awe of its divine magnificence. This is the legendary temple of Lord Krishna, which is known all over the world as the Dwarkadhish Temple.

Superlatives fall short when you gaze upon this sacred sanctuary, for such is its beauty and divine energy. But some have tried, giving it the names Jagat Mandir (universal shrine) and even Trilok Sundar (the most beautiful in all three worlds).

Believed to have been established centuries ago by Lord Krishna's great-grandson Vajranabh, the temple is a sacred cornerstone of the revered Char Dham pilgrimage, alongside Rameswaram, Badrinath, and Puri. The hallowed grounds of this temple have seen not just devotees and travellers but revered saints and sages too. One such example is that of Adi Shankara, the revered Hindu theologian and philosopher, who is believed to have visited the shrine in the 8th century. To this day, a memorial within the temple stands as a tribute to his visit.
