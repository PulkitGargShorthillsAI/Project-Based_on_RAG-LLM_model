KAMAKHYA-TEMPLE
The jewel of Nilanchal Hills
Seated atop the Nilanchal Hills, on the outskirts of Guwahati, the Kamakhya Temple beckons you with its mystical ambience. As one of India's most sacred sanctuaries devoted to Goddess Shakti, it stands as a timeless testament to the power of faith.

As you approach the temple, you can't help but marvel at the breathtaking panorama created by the temple's majestic dome against the backdrop of the Nilanchal Hills. At the main entrance, you'll be welcomed by intricately carved motifs adorned with vibrant blooms, an ode to the temple's blend of natural and artistic beauty. Within its ancient walls resides the revered Goddess Kamakhya, whose divine presence exudes an aura of unmatched grace and strength. The temple is steeped in centuries-old Tantric traditions, where animal sacrifices are made as part of the rituals.

The temple is also said to be the place where Goddess Sati’s womb and genitals fell, marking it as one of the revered 51 Shakti Peeths. It holds a unique celebration honouring the goddess's menstruation every year, called the Ambubachi Mela. During this event, the river near the temple is said to turn red – symbolising the goddess’s menstruation. You must visit the Kamakhya Temple during this festive time and experience it first-hand for an unforgettable mystical sojourn!
