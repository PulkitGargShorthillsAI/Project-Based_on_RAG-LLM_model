TRIPURA-SUNDARI-TEMPLE
A revered Shaktipeeth and a divine talisman of luck
Perched atop a hillock in Agartala, the Tripura Sundari Temple, also known as Matabari, is a marvel steeped in history and spirituality. Built by Maharaja Dhanya Manikya Dev in 1501 A.D, it is known to be the very spot where the right foot of Goddess Sati fell during Lord Shiva's tandava (dance of destruction), imbuing the earth with her divine presence. This makes the Tripura Sundari Temple one of the 51 Shaktipeeths (sacred places where the parts of Goddess Sati fell) scattered across the landscape of India.

The temple will draw your attention to its square-type sanctum, which has a typical Bengali-hut style construction along with a conical dome. But it is the presence of the sacred idols that will take your fascination to the next level. Inside, there are two identical images of the same deity. The idol of Goddess Tripura Sundari is the larger one, standing at a height of 5 feet. And beside her stands the smaller idol of Chhoto-Ma (little mother), which is only 2 feet tall. Chhoto Ma is the beloved symbol of Goddess Chandi, who is believed to bestow blessings of prosperity and protection upon her devotees. Legend has it that the smaller idol was carried by the kings of Tripura during battles and hunting expeditions, as it was believed to bring good fortune!

As you venture toward the temple's eastern precincts, a hidden gem awaits your discovery—a lake whose mirrored surface reflects the beauty of the temple's architecture, known as Kalyan Sagar. Here, amidst the gentle ripples, a harmonious ecosystem thrives, where fishes and tortoises bring another layer of serenity to the place.
