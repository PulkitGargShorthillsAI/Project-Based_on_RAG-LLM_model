VICTORIA-MEMORIAL
A treasure trove of Kolkataâ€™s heritage
Victoria Memorial, the masterpiece of marble stands like a vision of serenity on Strand Road, Kolkata. Though the monument has been an emblem of pride for the city, it was built by Lord Curzon in memory of the late Queen Victoria, the first Empress of British India.

After the colonizers left, this memorial was transformed into the most fascinating museum with genuine artefacts that once belonged to the Queen. Apart from her personal belongings, the museum also hosts paintings, original manuscripts, and memorabilia. The sheer luxury and opulence that drips from within the museum is breathtaking. One can walk from galleries to halls and spend hours learning about the richness and the opulence that the royalty enjoyed. After Independence, the Government included new halls in the museum which showcased the struggle of Indian freedom fighters, the injustice of the colonizers and many more stories of the local prince and princely states.

The sprawling greens that lay in front of Victoria Memorial is a sight to behold. It has intricately-manicured lawns, flower beds and sculptures, where one can spend hours during the sunny wintry morning and enjoy a slice of peace in the middle of a buzzing town.

Victoria Memorial is good for a great day out with family and friends. So, if you are thinking of soaking in every bit of the monument, we suggest you begin early and take your own sweet time to enjoy a blend of British royalty and the brave Indian life.
