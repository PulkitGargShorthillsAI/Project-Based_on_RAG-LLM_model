RED-FORT
A majestic marvel of Mughal architecture
Step back in time and immerse yourself in the grandeur of the Red Fort (or Lal Qila), Delhi's crown jewel and a UNESCO World Heritage site.

A symbol of power and beauty, the Red Fort was the heart of Shahjahanabad (present-day Old Delhi), the bustling new capital built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. In 1639, Shah Jahan decided to move his court from Agra to Delhi and ordered the Red Fort to be built as his majestic new home. It served as the residence of Mughal emperors for almost 200 years!

This architectural marvel, named for its towering red sandstone walls, along with the historic Salimgarh Fort, creates a stunning and expansive heritage site – the Red Fort Complex. The palace's design draws from Islamic traditions, yet each pavilion showcases a unique blend of Mughal architecture, seamlessly merging Persian, Timurid, and Hindu influences. This innovative style, coupled with its picturesque gardens, has left an indelible mark on architectural practices in Rajasthan, Delhi, Agra, and beyond.

As you explore, you will be mesmerised by its red sandstone facade, intricate carvings, majestic arches, and breathtaking marble structures. Marvel at the intricate private apartments, a series of elegant pavilions connected by the enchanting Nahr-i-Behisht, or ‘Stream of Paradise.’ The Red Fort is celebrated as the pinnacle of Mughal artistry, a testament to Shah Jahan's vision of exquisite refinement. The brilliance of its design is credited to the esteemed architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also crafted the iconic Taj Mahal.
