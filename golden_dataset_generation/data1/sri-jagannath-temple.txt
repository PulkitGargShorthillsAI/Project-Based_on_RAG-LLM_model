SRI-JAGANNATH-TEMPLE
Where faith and devotion touches the sky
On the eastern coast of India, lies the sacred town of Puri, a name synonymous with the iconic Jagannath Temple. This ancient shrine, dedicated to Lord Jagannath has been drawing pilgrims and seekers from across the world for nearly a millennium. Built in the 12th century AD, the temple stands as the beating heart of the Jagannath cult, its towering spire a beacon of faith visible for miles around. Rising majestically from a raised platform, this architectural marvel is more than just a place of worship. 

Unlike other temples in the region, the walls of Jagannath Temple are adorned predominantly with divine figures, creating a celestial pantheon in stone. The entire complex, enclosed within two concentric walls known as the Kuruma Bheda and Meghnad Pachira, tells a story of continuous evolution, with additions enhancing its grandeur well into the 16th century. 

As you approach the main entrance, the grand Singhadwara on the eastern face, you step into a space where ancient traditions remain vibrantly alive, and where every stone resonates with centuries of faith and cultural heritage.
