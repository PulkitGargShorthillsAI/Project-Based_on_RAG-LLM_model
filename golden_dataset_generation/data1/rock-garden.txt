ROCK-GARDEN
A world of artistic wonders
Amid the modern marvels of Chandigarh's urban landscape, a hidden gem beckons those seeking an enchanting escape into a realm where discarded remnants are transformed into breathtaking works of art. The Rock Garden, a sprawling open-air exhibition, is a testament to the boundless creativity of the human spirit.

Crafted by a former road inspector, Nek Chand, in 1957, this extraordinary garden is also known as Nek Chand's Rock Garden. Spread across a massive 40-acre wonderland, this kaleidoscope of sculptures and a colourful mosaic of art pieces redefines the boundaries of creativity.

Meticulously divided into three distinct phases, each area unveils a unique collection of installations and embellishments, inviting you to embark on a journey through a world where terracotta pots, light fixtures, and even broken toilet pots are reimagined into extraordinary masterpieces.

With over 5,000 statues adorning its borders, the Rock Garden reflects the transformative power of art. It is an open-air exhibition celebrating the best from waste, where every turn unveils a fresh interpretation of the mundane elevated into the extraordinary.
