THE-FRENCH-QUARTER
A tale of colonial splendour
Welcome to Puducherry's charming French Quarter, a captivating destination that takes you on an amazing journey back in time. This captivating "White Town," or Ville Blanche as locals often refer to it, stands as an irresistibly charming reminder of Puducherry's rich colonial heritage, where its distinctive blend of French and Indian architecture creates an incredible ambiance.

Puducherry had been passed between several colonial powers such as Dutch, Portuguese, English and - most notably - French colony during its history, eventually becoming part of India in 1954 and the Union Territory of Puducherry in 1963. Even today there remains strong French influence within Puducherry despite becoming part of India as an Indian State.
