SRI-VIJAYA-PURAM
Dive into turquoise waters, delve into an island's colonial secrets
Sri Vijaya Puram, formerly known as Port Blair, the capital of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, is far more than a typical beach destination. While it boasts the turquoise waters of the Bay of Bengal and rainforests lush with emerald secrets, it also holds a storied past etched in the remnants of a bygone era. Picture a phoenix rising from the ashes of a penal colony—that's Sri Vijaya Puram. Established in 1789 and named after Captain Archibald Blair of the East India Company, this city has witnessed the establishment of penal colonies by the Britishers where convicts, primarily political prisoners, were subjected to life imprisonment under inhumane conditions. It also saw the resistance of imprisoned freedom fighters. Sri Vijaya Puram offers a journey through history while treating all your senses to new experiences.



MAHATMA-GANDHI-MARINE-NATIONAL-PARK
Protecting the precious marine life
Covering an expansive area of 281.5 square kilometres, the Mahatma Gandhi Marine National Park, established on the Andaman Islands near Wandoor, is a protected sanctuary and serves as a haven for marine life, coral reefs, and endangered species. It stands as a testament to the importance of conservation and the marvels of nature.



CHIDIYA-TAPU
A haven for nature enthusiasts and bird watchers
Chidiya Tapu, 'Bird Island'. Nestled on the southernmost tip of South Andaman Island, around 28 kilometres from Sri Vijaya Puram, this little haven boasts a rich history whispered by the rustling mangroves and the calls of exotic birds. Legends say Chidiya Tapu was once a sacred ground for the indigenous Jarawa tribe. Today, it's a mosaic of experiences. Imagine a horseshoe-shaped beach, cradled by emerald forests on one side and dramatic cliffs on the other. The sand stretches out like a welcome mat, and the turquoise waters of the Andaman Sea lap gently at the shore, their rhythmic dance a constant lullaby.  

The road trip you take to reach Chidiya Tapu isn't just a journey, it paves the way to an unspoiled haven of natural beauty. From Sri Vijiya Puram you can hire a cab or opt for a self-driven trip to reach this nature's paradise.



RUBBER-PLANTATIONS-IN-WANDOOR
The largest, the most scenic plantations
Rubber is one of the most significant cultivations on the island and there are many spots where you can observe the manufacturing process. But, it is best showcased in the vast rubber plantations of Wandoor. These are the most scenic plantations, nestled amidst the lush greenery of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, offering a captivating glimpse into the world of rubber cultivation. Covering an expansive area of approximately 931 hectares, these plantations are the largest in Andaman.

The plantations, with around ten thousand rubber trees, are a testament to sustainable agriculture in the Andaman archipelago. Wandoor's location in the South Andaman region provides the ideal climate for rubber cultivation, ensuring robust growth and high-quality latex production.



NETAJI-SUBASH-CHANDRA-BOSE-ISLAND
A journey back in time
At just a short boat ride from Sri Vijaya Puram lies a unique gem, inviting travellers seeking both history and natural beauty to visit its shores. Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Island, formerly known as the Ross Island provides an intriguing window into India's colonial history as well as freedom struggle.

Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, the leader of the Indian National Army, is believed to have visited the island in 1943, and many claim that he even hosted the tricolour over the Government House as a symbol of defiance against colonial rule. In December 2018, this island was renamed as Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Island as a fitting tribute to his contributions towards the Indian freedom struggle, honouring the indomitable spirit of the Indian freedom fighter.



WANDOOR-BEACH
As far as the eye can sea
With a shoreline stretching up to 15kms and surrounded by lush forests, Wandoor Beach is a testament to the natural beauty of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. With clean white sands and crystal-clear waters, the Beach is easily accessible at just 25kms southwest of Sri Vijaya Puram. 

Gateway to Mahatma Gandhi Marine National Park, Wandoor Beach serves as a haven for marine biodiversity, making it a must-visit for nature enthusiasts and adventure seekers alike.



MOUNT-MANIPUR-NATIONAL-PARK
Discover serenity in nature's sanctuary
Amidst the lush greenery of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Mount Manipur National Park stands as a testament to the enduring spirit of conservation and renewal. Mount Manipur, the crown jewel of the park, is the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago’s third tallest peak, soaring to a majestic 1,257 feet.

Renamed from Mount Harriet National Park to Manipur National Park in the honour of the cultural heritage of Manipur and the “significant contribution” the Northeastern state had made in resisting the British, especially during the historic 1891 Anglo-Manipur war. This sanctuary of biodiversity embodies a rich tapestry of history, natural beauty, and ecological diversity.



CELLULAR-JAIL
The murky reminder of tyranny
In the picturesque Islands of Andaman and Nicobar, one would never imagine a colonial prison to exist. Yet, in such a location of divine beauty stands the Cellular Jail, also known as Kala Pani - Black Water, upright in the heart of Sri Vijaya Puram. This three-storeyed prison, constructed by the British in 1906, is a pilgrimage destination for freedom fighters, now dedicated to the nation as a National Memorial.

Along with the colour puce, the walls of the Cellular jail are stained with unforgettable tales of oppression and colonial tyranny. This colossal edifice has mutely witnessed the most treacherous of inhumane atrocities borne by the convicts, who were mostly freedom fighters.

When the ship of James Peterson Walker, the superintendent of Penal settlement, landed on this island, so did a group of 200 chained freedom fighters who were the first to revolt against the Union Jack. Forced to build the abyss they were caged in, many took their last breath in the dream of being free and setting foot in the motherland free from oppression.

The Cellular Jail is not just a monument but also a profound testament to the human cost of freedom. It is a place that stirs emotions, compels reflection, and ignites a deep appreciation for the hard-won liberties we enjoy today.



BARREN-ISLAND
A fiery heart
Situated in the Andaman Sea, Barren Island is approximately 138 kilometres northeast of Sri Vijaya Puram, the capital city of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It is renowned for being South Asia's only active volcano, which last erupted in 2017. The island spans about 3 square kilometres and is predominantly covered by volcanic cones and ash, with little vegetation visible from afar. The rugged terrain, surrounded by crystal-clear waters and coral reefs, creates a stark yet fascinating landscape unlike any other in the Indian subcontinent.

A serene seaside getaway
Corbyn's Cove, located just a few kilometres south of Sri Vijaya Puram, is one of the most picturesque beaches in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
