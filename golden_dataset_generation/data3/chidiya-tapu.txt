CHIDIYA-TAPU
A haven for nature enthusiasts and bird watchers
Chidiya Tapu, 'Bird Island'. Nestled on the southernmost tip of South Andaman Island, around 28 kilometres from Sri Vijaya Puram, this little haven boasts a rich history whispered by the rustling mangroves and the calls of exotic birds. Legends say Chidiya Tapu was once a sacred ground for the indigenous Jarawa tribe. Today, it's a mosaic of experiences. Imagine a horseshoe-shaped beach, cradled by emerald forests on one side and dramatic cliffs on the other. The sand stretches out like a welcome mat, and the turquoise waters of the Andaman Sea lap gently at the shore, their rhythmic dance a constant lullaby.  

The road trip you take to reach Chidiya Tapu isn't just a journey, it paves the way to an unspoiled haven of natural beauty. From Sri Vijiya Puram you can hire a cab or opt for a self-driven trip to reach this nature's paradise.
