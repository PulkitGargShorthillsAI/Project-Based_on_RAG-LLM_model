DZUKOU-VALLEY
Sculpted to perfection
When you think of nature's visual spectacles, the Dzukou Valley immediately comes to mind. Situated between the states of Nagaland and Manipur, this valley is a testament to nature's unparalleled artistry. At an elevation of 8045 feet, the undulating hills and knolls create an awe-inspiring landscape with intricately woven folds and contours that are truly one-of-a-kind.

What sets this valley apart is its remarkable transformation in the first weeks of July when it becomes adorned with a vibrant carpet of wildflowers. While the valley boasts a wide range of flowers throughout the seasons, the "Dzükou Lily" stands out as the most famous. Imagine being surrounded by this breathtaking floral paradise – it's an experience that promises to be nothing short of enchanting.
