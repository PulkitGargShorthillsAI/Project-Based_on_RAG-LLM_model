BRAHMA-SAROVAR
Not just water but salvation of the soul
The ancient water pool, the largest ‘sarovar’, the cradle of civilization when Brahma created the universe out of Kurukshetra! Welcome to Brahma Sarovar, one of the most sacred water bodies in Hinduism, where devotees from across the world come to bathe for purity.

3600 feet long, 1500 feet broad, and 45 feet deep, it is one of Asia’s largest man-made ponds. Legend has it that Brahma initiated the creation of the universe from Kurukshetra through a grand yajna. The waters of Brahma Sarovar in this sacred land were thus crucial to the genesis of existence itself.

From Abul-Fazl of Emperor Akbar's court who compared Brahma Sarovar to a mini sea, to Al Beruni who wrote about it in his 'Kitab-ul-Hind' in the eleventh century AD, travelers through ages have marveled at its vastness in their memoirs.

Even the Mahabharata mentions it, recounting how Duryodhana sought refuge in its waters during the war's conclusion, guarded by the divine Dharam. In fact, the story of Mahabharata is so deeply rooted here that the ghats of the sarovar are named after many of its prominent characters. Once called Ramahard and Samanta Panchaka, it's also linked to Parshuram, an incarnation of Vishnu.

People flock here during solar eclipses, believing a dip in its waters equals the blessings of thousands of horse sacrifices. Come for the salvation of your soul too!
