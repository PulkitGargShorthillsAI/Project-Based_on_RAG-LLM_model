CHERRAPUNJEE
Where raindrops write poetry
In the mystical embrace of Meghalaya, where clouds gather like old friends, lies Cherrapunjee—a place where rain isn't just a weather phenomenon; it's a symphony. Imagine skies whispering secrets in drizzles and monsoons, where every droplet carries tales of ancient and forgotten monsoons. Perched on the edge of the Himalayas, the city cradles its clouds. They arrive, weary from their journey across distant seas, seeking refuge among the misty hills. Here, they roost on moss-covered branches, their silver-gray feathers brushing against ancient rocks. The air smells of petrichor—the earth's sigh of relief as raindrops kiss its parched skin.

Emerald-green terraced fields cling to steep slopes, defying gravity. Waterfalls cascade down cliffs, their voices echoing through valleys. Each blade of grass wears a dewdrop necklace, and ferns unfurl like delicate manuscripts: the forest, dense and secretive, harbors stories of mythical creatures and forgotten tribes. Also known as Sohra, Cherrapunjee dances to the rhythm of rain. Its monsoons are legendary, turning streets into rivulets and rooftops into waterfalls. Umbrellas bloom like wildflowers, and children splash in puddles, their laughter echoing off mist-shrouded cliffs. The skies weep, and the earth drinks as if replenishing its soul.

Often hailed as one of the wettest places on Earth, it captivates visitors with its lush landscapes, majestic waterfalls, and remarkable living root bridges.



DOUBLE-DECKER-LIVING-ROOT-BRIDGE
An ode to the harmony between nature and human innovation
Deep in the East Khasi Hills there exists a wonder that is the epitome of nature's resilience and human innovation. Behold, the magical living root bridges of Meghalaya. Over 180 years ago, the elders of the Khasi clan set out on an extraordinary mission to built bridges by placing rubber tree roots into the hollow Canes of Areca Nut Palms until they intertwined across streams and became strong enough to bear humanity's weight. These marvels are vivid reminders that when humans work with nature the results can only ever be magnificent.

Straight out of a fantasy fiction novel stands their crowning jewel; a living root bridge that is not single but double decker! Interestingly, this bridge was made to be multi-storeyed due to the river rising high one season and covering the original bridge!
