HAR-KI-PAURI
Welcome to the ghat of legends
Haridwar is synonymous with Har Ki Pauri, a spiritual landmark on the banks of the holy Ganga river which draws devotees from far and wide. The name Har Ki Pauri translates to the feet (pauri) of Lord Vishnu (Har means God). This place is a revered ghat on the banks of the river Ganga and is renowned for being the very spot where Ganga leaves the mountains.

It is said that Lord Vishnu appeared at this very spot during the Vedic period and his footprints formed beneath the waters of the river Ganga. Within Har Ki Pauri lies an area called Brahmakund, where the evening Ganga Aarti takes place. This is the very spot where drops of Amrit (the elixir of immortality) fell from the sky while being carried in a pitcher by Garuda (the mount of Lord Vishnu) after the Samudra Manthan. It is also believed that the holy trinity, Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh, have also graced the sacred Brahmakund with their divine presence.

The sheer magnitude of this placeâ€™s spiritual significance makes it the centre of grand Hindu gatherings, hosting the colossal Kumbh Mela and Ardh Kumbh Mela, where pilgrims converge in large numbers to partake in rituals and take a holy dip to wash away their sins. Such is the extent to which, over the years, the ghats have undergone major extensions and renovations to accommodate the crowds during the Kumbh Melas.

Embraced by the whispers of the mountain breezes and adorned with the fragrant offerings of marigold garlands, Har Ki Pauri is a sanctuary where faith and devotion converge in a mesmerizing dance. As the sun sets behind the distant horizon, the evening aarti ignites the sky with a kaleidoscope of flickering flames, weaving a spellbinding spectacle that transcends the boundaries of time and space.
