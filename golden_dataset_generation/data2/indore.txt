In the heart of Indore stands the hallowed Maa Annapurna Temple, a sanctuary that pays homage to the goddess of food and nourishment, a manifestation of the revered Goddess Parvati herself.Offering nourishment has been a sacred rite in Hinduism since ancient times, and this temple stands as an embodiment of that profound tradition. Its origins trace back to the 9th century when it was first constructed. However, Mahamandaleshwar Swami Prabanandagirimharaj renovated this sacred sanctuary in 1959, for the sake of devotional grandeur.As one approaches the shrine, the majestic entrance that was erected in 1975 is supported by four regal elephants.
