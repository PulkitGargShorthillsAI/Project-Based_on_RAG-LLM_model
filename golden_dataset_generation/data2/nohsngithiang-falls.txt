NOHSNGITHIANG-FALLS
Nature's raw power, forever frozen in time
In the heart of Meghalaya, a state renowned for itsÂ mesmerising natural beauty and enigmatic charm, lies a hidden gem that beckons adventurers and nature enthusiasts alike. Nohsngithiang Falls, also known as the Seven Sisters Falls or Mawsmai Falls, is a beautiful spectacle showcasing nature's raw power and majesty.

One of the most striking features of Meghalaya is its incredible biodiversity. The abundant rainfall gives rise to numerous waterfalls, including the stunning Nohkalikai Falls and the Elephant Falls, which attract visitors from far and wide.

Meghalaya is also famous for its ancient living root bridges, some of the beautiful examples of work done by the local Khasi tribe. These bridges, made by intertwining and guiding the roots of rubber trees across rivers, take decades to form and can support the weight of multiple people. The most famous of these bridges is the Double Decker Living Root Bridge in the village of Nongriat, which is a sight to behold.
