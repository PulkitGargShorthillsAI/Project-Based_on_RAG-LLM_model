KHAWNGLUNG-WILDLIFE-SANCTUARY
From legendary to sanctuary
Welcome to Khawnglung Wildlife Sanctuary, a hidden gem tucked away in the lush landscapes of Mizoram, India. This sanctuary is a haven for biodiversity enthusiasts and nature lovers alike. Spanning over 35 square kilometres at an elevation of 1300 meters, it is home to a diverse range of flora and fauna and offers a unique opportunity to witness the beauty of the untouched wilderness.

With sheer cliffs on all sides, the mountain has been a natural shelter for humans and animals for ages, and that is why, in 2000, it was declared a wildlife sanctuary. Reaching this sanctuary is a bit of a challenge — a ten-kilometre trek through rough terrain- but the reward is worth it!

In the verdant confines of the Khawnglung Wildlife Sanctuary, flora and fauna intertwine to create everlasting memories. In the dappled light filtering through the canopy, you may find the majestic leopard prowling with silent grace - a symbol of the sanctuary's untamed spirit. Overhead, the calls of gibbons ring out, their sounds blending with the rustle of leaves and the gentle murmur of streams. Amidst the verdant undergrowth, the sturdy wild boar roots for sustenance while the barking deer and sambar deer traverse the landscape with elegance and poise. And high above, the hoolock monkeys swing from branch to branch.
As day fades into night, the sanctuary comes alive with the symphony of nocturnal creatures, their calls echoing through the darkness. Here, amidst the timeless beauty of Khawnglung, a sanctuary of life is waiting to be explored and cherished.
