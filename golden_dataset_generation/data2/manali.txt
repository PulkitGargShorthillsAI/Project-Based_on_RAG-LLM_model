MANALI
A treasure trove of inspiration and wisdom
Manali is located in the heart of Himachal Pradesh. According to Hindu mythology, the town's name is derived from "Manu-Alaya," which means "the abode of Manu," the first man and the lawgiver. Legend has it that sage Manu stepped off his ark here to recreate human life after a great flood had deluged the world. Manali is often referred to as the "Valley of the Gods" and is nestled in the majestic Himalayas, showcasing the unparalleled creativity of nature. The town's snow-capped peaks, pure rivers, deep woods, and lush green valley’s combine to create a visual symphony that truly tantalises the senses.

One of the must-visit places in Manali is the Hadimba Devi Temple, dedicated to Hadimba, the wife of Bhima, a hero of the Pandava clan in the epic Mahabharata. A unique fact of the temple is that it was built to honour a demoness. The temple's Pagoda-style architecture, with its four-tiered structure made of wood and stones, a metal roof, and a 24-metre-high Shikhara is a captivating feature. The nearby Vashisht village is well-known for its 4,000-year-old Vashisht temple, one of the seven great Vedic sages, known as the Saptarishis and sulphurous hot springs said to have extraordinary therapeutic properties. Adjacent to the springs, are temples honouring Lord Shiva and Lord Rama.

The Manu temple is dedicated to Rishi Manu who codified the Hindu laws in his book ‘Manusmriti’. The temple is made of stone, wood and tiles and is the only temple in India in his honour. Brighu Lake, legend has it that this was where the great sage Maharishi Bhrigu meditated. The waters of the lake never freeze. Locals believe that the gods and goddesses of the valley come here for a dip.
