Puducherry, formerly known as Pondicherry, gained its significance as "the French Riviera of the East" after the advent of French colonisation in India. Puducherry is the Tamil interpretation of "new town" and mainly derives from "Poduke", the name of the marketplace or "port town" for Roman trade in the 1st century. The settlement was once an abode of learned scholars versed in the Vedas, hence it was also known as Vedapuri. Often referred to as the French capital of India, Puducherry is a vibrant, coastal city with a quaint charm. The original name of the territory, Putucceri, is derived from the Tamil words putu (“new”) and ceri (“village”) or "New settlement". The French changed this to Pondichéry, which it was called until its name was officially changed to Puducherry in 2006. The city sits on the southeastern coast of India, about 170 kms from Chennai.



PUDUCHERRY-MUSEUM
Tales from the past, stories for the soul
Immersing oneself in the museum experience is enhanced by discovering a section that honors Sri Aurobindo, an esteemed Indian philosopher who brought Integral Yoga into mainstream consciousness. Personal belongings, manuscripts and photographs from his spiritual collaborator, as well as personal effects such as clothing allow visitors to gain an intimate glimpse into his life and profound teachings.

The museum dazzles visitors with an impressive collection of traditional handicrafts and handlooms created by skilled local artisans. Take time to admire sculptures, textiles, coins, and other artifacts that reflect the artistic and cultural richness of this region. Historically-minded visitors will also appreciate an impressive array of swords, armour, manuscripts, archaeological finds, and artifacts which provide glimpses into past civilizations which once flourished here.

The museum features artefacts that were excavated from the Arikamedu cultural site, including stones, jewellery, coins, and statues, excavated by the Acheological Survey of India. These illustrate the significance of Pondicherry as a port of trade between the first and second centuries AD. During that time, it was a well-known marine hub that catered to French, Chola, and Roman traders. Of particular historical importance is Governor Duplex's grand bed which holds pride of place among other rooms which contain geological wonders, fossil displays, coin collections, exquisite French furniture pieces, as well as church relics that all add charm to this historic attraction. Hence why the Puducherry Museum remains such a revered stop during your travels through charming city life!

From ancient Roman coins to French furniture, from traditional Indian textiles to one of the largest collection of Chola bronze sculptures, the museum has Puducherry's history engulfed in it.



EGLISE-DE-NOTRE-DAME-DES-ANGES
Witness a gothic and baroque marvel
Amidst the profound embrace of history and faith stands a monument steeped in old-world charm.  Our Lady of Angels Church of Pondicherry is known by many names—Église Notre Dame des Anges, Kaps Koil, White Chapel because of its white marble architecture, and Dumas Church owing to its location on Dumas Street. You'd be surprised to know that it is the world's only church where prayers resonate in French, Tamil, and English—the languages of puducherry.

Located along the famous Promenade of Pondicherry, this church was crafted by the skilled hands of Louis Guerre in 1855. The result was an architectural gem inspired by classic Greco-Roman architecture. It was originally a pristine white marble-like beauty that earned the church the endearing nickname of White Chapel. In reality, it was made up of a mix of limestone and eggshell to resemble a white marble texture. The colours of the chapel were later changed during the 1900s and 2000s.

The bell tower of this heavenly abode graces Puducherry's skyline, and the church itself bears a striking resemblance to Lourdes Basilica in South France. Together, these iconic sights leave visitors spellbound by their captivating beauty.

At the entrance of the Eglise de Notre Dame des Anges, you will find the sculpture of Mother Mary as she holds baby Jesus close in her arms. Venture into a grand and spacious hall whose high ceilings seem to reach the heavens, bathed in natural light filtering through its stunning stained-glass windows, casting vibrant hues across its sanctuary. When immersing yourself in its captivating architecture and serene sanctum, you experience an overwhelming sense of awe - perfectly harmonising with its sacred ambience.
