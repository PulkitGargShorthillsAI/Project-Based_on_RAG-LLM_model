Q: What is the relationship between Daksha Prajapati, Goddess Sati, and Lord Shiva, and how does this relate to the Daksha Mahadev Temple and Sati Kund?
Actual Answer: Daksha Prajapati is the father of Goddess Sati, who is married to Lord Shiva. Daksha did not accept Shiva as his son-in-law, which led Sati to self-immolate herself in the Yagna Kund. The Daksha Mahadev Temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, and the Sati Kund marks the spot where Sati self-immolated, thus the temple and kund are closely linked to this mythology.
A: Daksha Prajapati was the father of Goddess Sati, who married Lord Shiva.  The Daksha Mahadev Temple and Sati Kund commemorate Sati's self-immolation at a yagna (sacrifice) performed by her father, who disapproved of her marriage.  The temple and kund are thus sacred sites related to this significant event in Hindu mythology.
