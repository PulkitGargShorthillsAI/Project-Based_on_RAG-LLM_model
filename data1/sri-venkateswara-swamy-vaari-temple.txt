SRI-VENKATESWARA-SWAMY-VAARI-TEMPLE
The temple that saves mankind
One of the wealthiest temples in the world is situated in the Tirumala Hills, a part of the Seshachalam Hills range with seven peaks, symbolizing the seven heads of Adishesha. This temple is called as the ‘Temple of Seven Hills’, with its location on the seventh peak—Venkatadri. Welcome to Sri Venkateswara Swamy Vaari Temple, also known as the Tirumala Temple or Tirupati Balaji Temple.

Dedicated to Venkateswara, a form of Vishnu, this temple in Tirupati is believed to save mankind from the trials of Kali Yuga, earning it the name ‘Kaliyuga Vaikuntha’ and its deity is known as ‘Kaliyuga Prathyaksha Daivam’. It is one of the Pancha Kshethram temples, where Maha Lakshmi was born as Bhargavi.

Built by a Thondaman king around 300 CE, the temple has been periodically reformed by Cholas, Pandyas, and Vijayanagara rulers. The presiding deity, Venkateswara, stands in the Garbhagruha (Sanctum Sanctorum), facing east.

The temple complex with South Indian architecture includes modern Queue buildings, Annaprasadam complex, and lodging sites for pilgrims. Legends abound about the temple's deity manifestation in Tirumala, with one stating that the deity will remain throughout the present Kali Yuga.

The temple is one of the most visited religious sites globally, with footfall surpassing 60,000 daily and reaching over a hundred thousand during festivals and holidays.
