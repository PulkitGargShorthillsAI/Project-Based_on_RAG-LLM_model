HARIDWAR
Where people come seeking purification and spiritual liberation
Haridwar, also known as Mayapuri in ancient times, lies along the right bank of the Ganges River, nestled at the foothills of the Shivalik ranges. It exactly means ‘An Entryway to God’. According to legend, Haridwar is one of the four sites where drops of amrita (the elixir of immortality) accidentally spilt over from a celestial pitcher during the Samudra Manthana (churning of the ocean of milk). The spot where the amrita fell is believed to be Brahma Kund, located at Har ki Pauri, which is considered the most sacred ghat in Haridwar.

It is here that the Kumbha Mela takes place every 12 years. During this auspicious occasion, millions of pilgrims, devotees, and tourists gather to perform ritualistic bathing on the banks of the Ganges, seeking purification and spiritual liberation (moksha).



CHANDI-DEVI-TEMPLE
The place where wishes come true
Known for its legendary temples, ashrams, and pilgrimage sites, Haridwar is an important destination that draws countless devotees and tourists from across the globe. And in this hallowed place, lies a renowned temple, built in honour of a goddess who is a demon slayer. Welcome to the Chandi Devi Temple in Haridwar.

Amidst the serene beauty of the Shivalik Hills, you will find this beautiful temple perched atop the Neel Parvat. It's said that if you harbour an unfulfilled wish within your heart, make a pilgrimage to this temple (also known as the Neel Parvat Teerth, one of the five sacred pilgrimages of Haridwar), and Goddess Chandi Devi will turn your deepest desires into reality. This makes it Siddha Peetha (a place of worship where desires get fulfilled), one of three such Peethas located in Haridwar, the other two being Mansa Devi Temple and Maya Devi Temple.

While the temple was constructed in 1929 by King Suchat Singh of Kashmir, legend has it that the temple’s main idol, Chandi Devi, was put there in the 8th century by Adi Shankaracharya, a revered saint who sought to harness the celestial energies of the Himalayas. Since then, it has remained a beacon of spiritual enlightenment, drawing devotees who seek solace, guidance, and blessings from the divine mother.

Beyond its spiritual significance, the Chandi Devi Temple also offers breathtaking panoramic views of the sacred city of Haridwar and the meandering course of the holy Ganga River below. Not to mention, watching the sunset here remind you of the eternal bond between nature, spirituality, and humanity.



MANSA-DEVI-TEMPLE
Enter a realm of profound reverence
In the sacred land of Haridwar, atop the lofty Bilwa Parvat, a divine presence watches over the faithful - the revered Mansa Devi Temple, one of the five sacred sites, Panch Tirthas of Haridwar. Revered as the goddess of snakes who grants wishes, Maa Mansa Devi's temple stands as one of the most ancient and renowned Siddhpeeth sites. Perched atop the Shivalik Hills at a height of over 500 feet, this sacred abode holds great significance for devotees seeking divine blessings and spiritual fulfilment.

It is believed that an embodiment of Shakti's infinite grace is said to have emerged from the very depths of Lord Shiva's consciousness, a manifestation of pure, unwavering desire at this same spot in the form of goddess Mansa Devi. Together with the hallowed Maya Devi Temple and the sacred Chandi Devi shrine, these three sanctums form the triad of Pithas that bless the holy city, weaving an intricate tale of devotion and mysticism.

Within the inner sanctum of Mansa Devi's abode, two divine forms hold court - one, an eight-armed avatar (manifestation), the other, a three-headed, five-armed embodiment of cosmic unity. It is firmly believed that the goddess of desire, Mansa Devi, fulfils the earnest longings of all who venture forth with unwavering faith. Devotees tie threads upon the branches of the ancient tree within the complex, each knot a hopeful whisper carried upon the celestial winds. And when desires become reality, the faithful return, untying those sacred knots as offerings of gratitude to the Almighty. Coconuts, fragrant blossoms, and swirling tendrils of incense rise in reverence, pleasing the goddess who holds the keys to the heart's deepest yearnings.
