London
Greater London, United Kingdom (UK)
Destination guide
World-class culture, fashion, music, and food â London has it all in spades. Combining a palpable sense of history with a vibrant cosmopolitan edge, this global metropolis has something for everyone.Â Â
Traditionalists will love the royal landmarks and slew of legend-heavy heritage buildings that date back centuries. Hipsters will find inspiration in the gritty East End â a hotbed of galleries, nightclubs, funky restaurants and street markets.Â Â Â
In terms of the sheer number of bucket list experiences in one place â nowhere even comes close. And yes, it rains, but the majority of Londonâs best bucket list experiences can be enjoyed equally whatever the weather; be it an international art museum, or a pint in a cosy 500-year-old pub.

Tower of London
London, United Kingdom (UK)
Bucket List Experience
The Tower of London is one of the UKâs most iconic and impressive historical attractions. Yes, itâs stuffed with tourists but for good reason: inside, youâll get up close to the Crown Jewels, including the Queenâs crown and the armour of the great Tudor King, Henry VIII. Its White Tower is the oldest intact building in London, built by William the Conqueror in the 11th century.
The resident Yeoman Warders (or Beefeaters) give excellent free tours of the various wings, uncovering some gruesome stories from the Towerâs role as a prison in the Middle Ages. This is where âtraitorsâ were executed â the water gate entrance, built by Edward I, witnessed a stream of prisoners enter the Tower for execution, including Anne Boleyn, Sir Thomas More and Catherine Howard. The unfortunate’s head would be displayed on a spike at London Bridge afterwards.
Look out for the resident ravens â legend has it that if they desert the tower, the kingdom will fall.

Houses of Parliament & Big Ben
London, United Kingdom (UK)
Bucket List Experience
There has been a Palace at Westminster since at least the 10thÂ century, but the neo-Gothic buildings that comprise the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben were built over a period of 23 years, between 1837-60.Â Designed by Sir Charles Barry and AWN Pugin, the building is set on a huge concrete plate on the banks of the Thames to keep the building stable. There are over 1,000 rooms, 100 staircases and three miles of passageways over four floors.
Today this is where the British Government meets, and although many visitors see these distinctive buildings as simply part of Londonâs historic skyline, itâs well worth venturing beyond the elegant facades to have a look inside.
Sit in on ‘Prime Minister’s Questions’ in the House of Commons or take a guided tour focusing on the decorativeÂ splendourÂ of the House of Lords.Â You can alsoÂ climb the Elizabeth Tower, which holds the clock famously known as Big Ben.

Buckingham Palace
London, United Kingdom (UK)
Bucket List Experience
Adopted as the British monarchâs official London residence on the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837, the worldâs most famous â if architecturally bland â royal palace is viewed by most visitors from the outside only. Walk up the Mall to get the most impressive view, and once youâve mingled with the crowds, dip into leafy St Jamesâ Park for coffee with the squirrels, who eat out of the hands ofÂ passersby.
In the summer months, the State Rooms and gardens open up to visitors; you can take your own picnic if visiting the gardens, and there are pre-bookable Gardenerâs Tours for green-fingered visitors.

British Museum
London, United Kingdom (UK)
Bucket List Experience
A must-do on every London visitorâs itinerary, the imposing, colonnaded British Museum truly lives up to the hype. One of the oldest museums in the world (established 1753), its enormously rich collection of more than seven million artefacts, many collected and brought back to London from across the world by British explorers and archaeologists during the days of the British Empire.
The ethics may be questionable, but it has ensured thousands of ancient relics that may otherwise have been lost have been safeguarded. Discussions go on about the rights of returning many of these artefacts to their original countries, but for the moment they are still on display to be enjoyed andÂ marvelledÂ at.
The addition in 2000 of a soaring, glass-domed atrium â the Great Court, designed by Norman Foster â brought a dash of contemporary cool to a historic landmark.

St Paulâs Cathedral
London, United Kingdom (UK)
Bucket List Experience
Instantly recognisable, and one of Londonâs best-loved monuments, St Paulâs Cathedral was the greatest achievement of 17th-century architect Sir Christopher Wren. Taking 33 years to build, it was declared officially complete on Christmas Day 1711 (although work continued for some time after) and remained the tallest building in London until 1967. Through astonishing luck â or perhaps divine intervention â St Paulâs survived (virtually unscathed) the 1940 World War II bombing blitz â and the ensuing fire â that flattened or destroyed almost every other building for miles around it.
Still the second largest cathedral in the UK, the church is famed for the height of its vast dome (111m) and the incredible acoustics of the Whispering Gallery. Legend has it that if you stand on one side of the gallery and whisper along the wall, someone listening on the opposite side (33mÂ away) will be able to hear you.

The Victorian Palm House is a centrepiece, alongside energy-efficient modern hothouses, an aquarium in the Princess of Wales Conservatory, and a raised treetop walkway (200m long and 18m high) through a woodland glade. Also look out for âThe Hiveâ, a 17m-high, multi-sensory experience to highlight the extraordinary life of bees.

Hampton Court Palace
London, United Kingdom (UK)
Bucket List Experience
A Tudor royal pleasure palace set in 60 acres of gorgeous formal gardens and 750 acres of parkland. Anyone with the remotest interest in English history will get a kick out of exploring this sprawling Tudor and Baroque estate, where the infamous Henry VIII lived, loved and held lavish banquets.
Navigating the UKâs oldest surviving hedge maze, commissioned around 1700, is something of a rite of passage for British kids, with families often opting to visit the gardens alone (maze-only tickets are available). But donât miss the Great Hall and royal apartments, the elaborate dome in the Chapel Royal or the gallery â reputedly haunted by Henryâs fated fifth wife, Catherine Howard.
You canÂ alsoÂ play Mary Poppins with a walk on the palace roof, on guided summertime tours that take in the intricate brickwork and chimneys and give VIP views of the estate.

Westminster Abbey
London, United Kingdom (UK)
Bucket List Experience
Despite religious wars and changing affiliations through the centuries,Â Westminster AbbeyÂ has been the traditional place of royal coronations, and the restingÂ place of monarchsÂ â since William the Conqueror arrived in 1066. In recent times, the Abbey has hostedÂ the funeral of Princess DianaÂ andÂ the royal wedding of Prince William to Kate Middleton.
The currentÂ buildingÂ was built on the orders of King Henry III in 1245. It has also become a final resting place for prominent citizens â poets, actors, scientists and military leaders. ItÂ contains the remains of 3,300Â notables, including 16 monarchs and 8 Prime Ministers.
Today, you can see the Coronation Chair, a throne where all British monarchs (bar two) have been crowned since 1066, Henry VIIâs chapel, and towers built by Sir Christopher Wren and his protege, Nicholas Hawksmoor. You can pay your respects to the British pillar of science, Sir Isaac Newton. Poetsâ Corner, in the South Transept, is a shrine to Britainâs most famous poets and writers, many of whom are buried or commemorated here. The tradition started when Geoffrey Chaucer, the father of English Literature, was interred here.

ZSL London Zoo
London, United Kingdom (UK)
Bucket List Experience
The days of small, barren enclosures and depressed animals are long gone -London Zoo has transformed into a model zoo for the 21st century. Enclosures are more spacious with richer vegetation, only holding large animals that are better suited to enclosures. The zoo also now focuses more on smaller (and often more interesting) creatures and habitats, with a strong conservation theme throughout, and an emphasis on education and interaction for children.
Donât miss the Asiatic lions or the Western Lowland gorillas (you canât possibly miss the giraffes).Â The newishÂ âTiger TerritoryâÂ isÂ an enclosure for two Sumatran tigers, which has been specially designed to mimic the tigerâs natural habitat with tall trees (for climbing) and a pool (tigers love to swim).
There’s also an adventure playground and a hugely popular ‘Bed Bugs’ initiative, where children aged 8-11 can stay overnight in the insect house, for games, storytelling and torch-lit exploration of the zoo.

World-class performing arts in London
London, United Kingdom (UK)
Bucket List Experience
Londonâs theatre and music scene is one of the oldest in the world – and its theatres and concert halls some of the most striking in design and architecture.
From the loving recreation of Shakespeareâs Globe theatre on the Southbank to the Brutalist blocks of the National Theatre, and the ornate Royal Albert Hall, with its unbeatable acoustics for orchestras, the buildings are as much a part of the story as the plays and concerts youâll see performed inside.
TheÂ famousÂ âWest Endâ (around Covent Garden and Soho) isÂ theÂ centreÂ of it all, home toÂ a collection of historic theatres which house a mixture of long-running plays and musicals and short-running shows.Â But youâll find great theatres as spread out as London Bridge, Hackney and Chelsea, too, often with a certain ethos, such as championing new writing or showcasing different styles of dance.

London Transport Museum

Tate Britain
London, United Kingdom (UK)
Bucket List Experience
This grand Portland stone building on the Thames, the original Tate Gallery, has lately been eclipsed by its edgier younger sibling, the Tate Modern. This is a pity â the Tate Britain houses an impressive collection of classical and modern British art thatâs second only to the National Gallery.
Come here to see evocative landscapes and striking portraits by British greats such as Gainsborough, Freud, Bacon and Constable â who gets an entire room to himself â as well as Turner, whose works number into the thousands.
The gallery is best known for its works by deceased painters, but the always-controversial annual Turner Prize (OctoberÂ toÂ January) is an exhibition of the best contemporary British art of that year â and a highlight of the London art calendar.

London, United Kingdom (UK)
Bucket List Experience
British food has undergone a revolution in the last twenty years; high-profile chefs such as Mark Hix and Fergus Henderson have sparked a culinary revival, with traditional flavours and dishes reinvented with contemporary techniques and ingredients.
Rich gravies and jus characterise many meat dishes; tangy with blackcurrants, red wine and handfuls of sage and marjoram, while strongly-flavoured hard cheeses â most notably Cheddar â flavour many vegetable and pasta dishes.
Bread remains a national passion; good bakers can be found everywhere, with chewy sourdough, fluffy white âbloomersâ and sugar-coated doughnuts (filled with raspberry jam) classic favourites. Traditional British desserts are sweet and treacley, while cakes are often rich with dried fruit.

An aristocratic habit started by the Duchess of Bedford in 1840, pausing for tea, cakes and sandwiches at three or four in the afternoon is a good old-fashioned English treat.
Although there are afternoon teas offered across the city (and just about everywhere and anywhere these days), for the authentic, traditional afternoon tea â as the Duchess would have expected it â you need to attend one of Londonâs historic, grand dame hotels.
The great and the good have been flocking to the grand salons ofÂ Claridges, the Savoy and the Ritz (among others) for over a century.

A food market has stood beside London Bridge since at least the 12th century, and the current model â with Victorian architecture and railway arches covering many of the food outlets â has had a huge revival in recent years as London has become one of Europeâs biggest foodie hubs.
Stalls range from traditional fruit and veg to artisan bakers, charcuterie, cheese counters and chocolatiers, with some of the capitalâs best restaurants in the historic streets that wind out from the main marketplace. UnquestionablyÂ Londonâs biggest culinary draw with over 100 stalls, itâs phenomenally popular with tourists, but local foodies also flock here for the fantastic street food, which ranges from artisan chorizo sandwiches to Egyptian curries, fresh pasta and IndianÂ dosas, eaten on the go as trains rumble overhead.

There are eight Royal Parks to explore,Â  originally created as hunting and pleasure grounds for the royal family, each one a different experience.
The oldest park, St James, dates back to 1532, when Henry VIII purchased the land for a deer park. Surrounded by palaces on three sides â Westminster, St Jamesâ and Buckingham â this is the heart of royal London, and where Elizabeth I held all manner of pageants and fetes during her reign.
The other main parks in central London are Hyde, Regents, St James and Green Park, while Richmond and Greenwich sit to the west and east respectively. All of the parks are dotted with cafes, and can be aÂ wonderful place to sit with a picnic and watch Londoners slowing the pace for an hour or two.

Royal Academy of Arts
London, United Kingdom (UK)

HostÂ of theÂ renownedÂ Summer Exhibition, the Royal Academy has been promoting art and artists since the 1700s.

Its permanent collection is one of Britainâs oldest. The 30,000-strong collection takes in such British greats as Reynolds, Turner and Constable, and masterpieces including Michelangeloâs TaddeiÂ Tondo.

Cutty Sark
London, United Kingdom (UK)
Bucket List Experience
This 150-year-old, 921-ton sailing ship was one of the last British âtea clippersâ (a merchant sailing ship) to be built â and is now the last surviving in the world. After it was badly damaged by a fire in 2007, conservation work preserved the vessel and raised it to reveal the go-faster carvings that powered it to the eastern tea ports.
TheÂ Cutty Sark now sits in a dry dock museum, where you can learn about the cargo she carried and the countless countries she visited during her 140-year lifespan. Climb aboard to explore the decks, step under the hull, and gaze up at her three masts soaring over the National Maritime Museum.
There are regular family events throughout the year, with plenty of hands-on fun. There’s also a kids’ gallery and a ship simulator aimed at children.

Richmond Park
London, United Kingdom (UK)
Experience
At a whopping 2,500 acres, taking in woodland, grassland, planted gardens and ponds, Richmond is the largest of Londonâs royal parks. Itâs changed little since its inception as a deer park by Charles I in the 1600s (although the landâs royal connection dates back to the 1200s).Â A sense of that royal history remains.
Deer, red and fallow, still graze and shape the park, their outline as distinctive as its ancient oaks. There’s a myriad of nature trails and cycleways, making it a fine place to walk, cycle and even horse ride. There are views of the cityâs St Paulâs Cathedral-crowned skyline from King Henryâs Mound.

Covent Garden
London, United Kingdom (UK)
Bucket List Experience
Covent Garden piazza is one of Londonâs best-lovedÂ touristÂ draws; a quaint old apple market, built in 1830, and converted in 1980 into a hubbub of street performers, cafes, bars and restaurants. The central covered quarter is home to the daily market; on Mondays itâs an antique-hunters heaven, while Tuesday toÂ Sunday sees stalls selling everything from hand-madeÂ jewelleryÂ to bespoke waistcoats, one-off clocks and hand-dyed scarves.
The two sub-ground terraces are home to two of Londonâs favourite watering holes, the Crusting Pipe, where buskers play classical music for the gathered drinkers, and the Punch & Judy, which also has a terrace overlooking the main piazza.
In culture and literature, this cobbled square is inextricably linked with the storyÂ PygmalionÂ and its musical adaptationÂ My Fair Lady.

For the most part, thereâs no curtain as such, although each show stages its production using the al fresco setting with varying degrees of ingenuity. Seasonal set pieces include crowd-pleasing Shakespeare plays such asÂ A Midsummer Nightâs DreamÂ andÂ Twelfth NightÂ (the debut show in 1932),Â butÂ theÂ theatre has won a very respectableÂ number of awards for productions that have transferred to the West End and Broadway.

Louvre Museum
Paris, Ile-de-France, France
Bucket List Experience
The worldâs most visited museum, the Louvre dates back to the 13th century, and was the primary residence of the French Royal family until Louis XVI moved the household to the Palais of Versailles in 1682. It opened as a museum in 1793 with 537 paintings â mainly from the Royal collection; today it houses 35,000 works of art and 380,000 objects.
The building is almost as much of an attraction as the exhibits; explore the grand galleries with ornately painted ceilings, opulent stairways and remnants of a medieval Parisian palace. Let yourself wander â and wonder â your way through the museumâs beautifully laid out, labyrinthine halls and discover world-class Italian Renaissance and French Neoclassical and Romantic painting, antique sculpture, treasures from Ancient Egypt and Assyria, or medieval gold and silverwares.
The sheer wealth of exhibits in the Louvre can be intimidating on the one hand; on the other, it means thereâs always something fascinating to discover.

Eiffel Tower
Paris, Ile-de-France, United Kingdom (UK)
Bucket List Experience
When French civil engineer Gustave Eiffel won a competition to design a building that would be unveiled at the 1889 World Fair in Paris, no-one could have foreseen that it would become one of the most iconic structures on the planet. Eiffelâs design won out against 106 other entries, with digging begun in January 1887, and the tower completed in time for the Exposition Universale two years later, held to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution.
Much derided at the time â in spite of being the tallest building in the world â it was only meant to stand for twenty years. More than a century later it remains a much-loved and iconic symbol of Paris; if you can stomach the crowds and the ride up in the vintage lift, the view from the top remains an enchanting treat.

It remains aÂ brilliantly over-the-top ode to the power of Louis XIV, with lavish Baroque rooms and sparkling mirrors lining the heavily-gilded Galerie des Glaces.
The opulent interiors are the main event, but a splendid park and gardens have plenty to keep visitors busy, too â with two further (Grand and Petit Trianon) palaces, a sheep farm, a Grand Canal and Marie Antoinetteâs private hameauÂ (hamlet or mini-village).

World-class art in Paris
Paris,  Ile-de-France, France

Few countries have defined the history of Western art like France; from the 19th century onwards, the country was considered the epicentre of the art world, with Paris as its heart.

Even today, cutting-edge galleries house the best modern and contemporary art, in spectacular buildings whose architecture is as much an attraction as the art inside. But the city is also an art capital thanks to its museums, which showcase everything from non-Western indigenous art and medieval sculpture, to Renaissance art and Impressionism.

Parisâ best food & drink
Paris, Ile-de-France, France
Bucket List Experience
Paris is one dynamic food metropolis â a culinary hub that ticks every edible box, whether youâre looking for classic steak-frites and onion soup or breakfast staples like baguette and croissants.
Old-school pleasures â chateaubriand beef and garlicky snails â abound on menus in many traditional eating houses (like bistros and brasseries), but nowadays the new generation of chefs is deconstructing traditional dishes to create their own, more elevated styles of food, often using ingredients sourced from neighbouring departements like Picardie (for potatoes and root vegetables) and Seine-et-Marne (for cheeses).

Orangerie Museum
Paris,  Ile-de-France, France
Bucket List Experience
Napoleon IIIâs former citrus greenhouse is (along with the Orsay Museum) one of the loveliest places in Paris to admire Impressionist and Modernist art.
Works by many of the big 19th- and 20th-century names are thereâ Renoir, Cezanne, Matisseâbut the stars of the show are Monetâs monumental ‘Water Lilies‘, which wrap around the galleryâs curved walls in pastel-hued beauty and draw crowds by the dozens.
Regular temporary exhibitions complete the offerings.
If you like coffee table books, youâll be well-served in the bookshop, which sells an excellent array of art-themed tomes.
The museum sits within the Jardin des Tuileries â after your visit, you should take a stroll through the park (former royal gardens), up towards the Louvre.

Boat tours of Paris
Paris, Ile-de-France, France
Bucket List Experience
Thereâs no better way to see the sights in one magical sweep than by boat along the Seine.
From the filigree girders of the Eiffel Tower to the giant clock of the Orsay Museum and the Mansard rooftops of the Louvre â not to mention the statue-studded bridges â the waterway provides a unique and crowd-free viewpoint for taking in the cityâs treasures.
Book aÂ diningÂ cruise onÂ a riverboat, hire your own privateÂ boatÂ orÂ opt for the hop-on-hop-off boat-buses. Theyâre all good, but for extra romance,Â goÂ at night, when the monuments are lit up and the Eiffel Tower sparkles.

Parisâ must-see architecture
Paris, IIe-de-France, France
Bucket List Experience
At first sight, Parisâs gorgeous golden stone gives the city an apparently uniform classical image. But beneath the illusion are numerous distinct periods of Parisian history â centuries of grandiose urban planning schemes, when kings and presidents left their mark on the cityâs look and landscape.
Today Paris stands out for its elegant squares and broad boulevards, peppered with Gothic churches, Baroque palaces and mansions, strings of prim, balconied Hausmann-style apartment buildings and adventurous modern icons.

La Conciergerie
Paris, Ile-de-France, France
Bucket List Experience
Along withÂ Sainte-Chapelle,Â the Conciergerie once formed part of a vast Medieval palace, with impressive, vaulted Gothic halls, that included the Sainte-Chapelle. Abandoned as a palace by the French Kings at the end of the 14thÂ century, it took on a more judicial role, and parts were converted to prison cells.
Today, itâs most famously remembered as the ‘antechamber to the guillotine’, where nobles were held prior to execution in the bloodiest days of the French Revolution. Prisoners included the Queen at the time of the French Revolution and the last Queen of France, Marie Antoinette. She was executed by guillotine in 1793 to the cheers of the populace â one of almost three thousand prisoners, mostly from the upper classes, to be tried and sentenced at the Conciergerie.
Now a historic monument, only a small area of the building is open to the public. A small, commemorative chapel now was erected on the site of Marie Antoinetteâs cell.

Moulin Rouge
Paris,  Ile-de-France, France
Experience
Fronted by a red windmill, this historical cabaret needs no introduction. Since opening the same year as the Eiffel Tower, in 1889, it has inspired paintings (most famously by Toulouse-Lautrec), and movies (like Baz Luhrmannâs 2001 hit film, Moulin Rouge), and is photographed by visitors from all around the world.
Today the showâs as glitzy as itâs kitschy, with themed scenes portraying the Circus, Pirates and the Moulin Rouge through the ages. Can Can, of course, takes centre stage and magic shows complete the offerings.
You can dine on French cuisine as you watch, or just opt for the show and champagne. Thereâs also a rooftop cocktail bar for pre- or post-show drinks and nibbles.

The Pantheon of Paris
Paris, Ile-de-France, France
Bucket List Experience
Built 1758-1790 at the behest of Louis XV of France, this grandiose monument to France’s ‘great men’ was originally intended to be a church dedicated to Sainte Genevieve. But during the French Revolution, it was converted into a mausoleum to house the remains of distinguished French citizens â to acknowledge and honour their contribution to the nation. The crypt contains the remains of 80 people, including the tombs of Voltaire, Hugo, Zola, Pierre and Marie Curie and Louis Braille.
Modelled on Rome’s Pantheon, the building is an early example of Neoclassicism, with a striking interior. The dome was designed to rival St. Peterâs Basilica in Rome and St. Paulâs Cathedral in London. Itâs 83m high, compared to 136m for St. Peterâs. You can climb the dome for city views.

Rodin Museum
Paris, Ile-de-France, France
Bucket List Experience
Francois Auguste Rene Rodin, born 1840, was a French sculptor, generally considered the founder of modern sculpture. His unconventional and unexpected works challenged the norm, but despite controversy and ridicule from traditionalists, his popularity grew and by 1900 he was world-renowned.
Displayed around the house and gardens where he lived at the end of his life, this fabulous museum collection illustrates how he revolutionised sculpture at the start of the 20th century â reworking figures and themes to create such iconic and distinctive works asÂ The Thinker,Â The Burghers of CalaisÂ andÂ The Gates of Hell.
Itâs surprisingly good for families, with special family audio guides designed to introduce kids to sculpture. They include an interactive plan with an audio pen â point the pen at an exhibit and hear the commentary.

Dali Museum, Paris
Paris, Ile-de-France, France
Experience
This museum in the Montmartre neighbourhood is dedicated to the surrealist artist Salvador Dali, displaying over 300 of his works.
Dali’s art is characterised by his unique blend of dreamlike and bizarre imagery, exploring the realms of the subconscious and the irrational. His works often featured melting clocks, distorted figures, and fantastical landscapes, reflecting his fascination with the subconscious mind and the exploration of the human psyche. His creativity also extended beyond the art world as he collaborated with filmmakers, designed sets, and even dabbled in fashion and jewellery design.
He lived in France throughout the Spanish Civil War (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success.

Museum of the Middle Ages
Paris, Ile-de-France, France
Experience
There couldnât be a more appropriate setting for Parisâ official museum of the Middle Ages than the Gothic townhouse â known asÂ Hotel de Cluny. It was originally built by the Abbot of Cluny in 1330, andÂ now standsÂ asÂ one of the oldest (former) private residences, and arguablyÂ the finest example of medieval civil architecture,Â in Paris.
Weapons,Â objets dâart, furnishings, stained-glass windowsÂ and manuscripts abound, but the star of the show is the celebrated late 15th-century La Dame a la LicorneÂ (Lady and the Unicorn) tapestry cycle.
Interestingly, there are almost two museums here in one. TheÂ Hotel de Cluny is housed inÂ the remains of a Roman thermal bathing complex. The baths, with 15m-high vaulted ceilings, have been restored and also now houseÂ the Pillar of the Nauti (Pillar of the Boatmen), the cityâs oldest sculpture, dating back to 1349 AD.

Victor Hugoâs House
Paris, Ile-de-France, France
Experience
This apartment where famous French poet and novelist Victor Hugo (1802-1885) lived for 16 years, is now a museum about his life and works.
Author of ‘Les MisÃ©rables’ and ‘The Hunchback of Notre-Dame’, Hugo is considered one of the most influential figures in French, if not world, literature and was a key player in the Romantic movement. His works are typified by exceptional storytelling abilities and his passion for social justice. His writing delves into themes of love, redemption, and the plight of the marginalised.
He was also an engaged political activist, advocating for causes like freedom of expression and the abolition of the death penalty, so much so that his legacy continues to resonate in the worlds of literature and social activism.

Montmartre & the Sacre-Coeur Basilica
Paris, Ile-de-France, France
Bucket List Experience
This large hill in Pariâs 18thÂ arrondissementÂ may be overrun with visitors, but the village-like neighbourhood of Montmartre is also incredibly charming, with its cute houses, artistsâ studios and steep stairways.
Itâs known for its long artistic history â in the 18th and 19th centuries many artists lived and worked or had studios in Montmartre, leaving it a unique bohemian charm.
Its other claim to fame is the sugary-white domed church of Sacre-Coeur, built in 1914 â the interior is a feast of glittering neo-Byzantine mosaics. It crowns Parisâs highest hill and offers the best panoramic views of the city from atop its dome (open to visitors).
The main square â Place duÂ TertreÂ â is horribly crowded with tourists and packed with pseudo-artists, but there are still authentic corners to be discovered in the side streets lower down the hill. For a moreÂ laid-backÂ side of Montmartre, explore the cafÃ©s and shops along Rue des Abbesses, RueÂ LepicÂ and Rue des Trois-FrÃ¨res.
Other attractions here include Montmartre Cemetery, the Montmartre Museum, and the DalÃ­ Paris Museum.
Itâs a go-to for all tourists and first-timers, but the area still hasÂ charm andÂ a wonderfully bohemian air.

Gustave Moreau Museum

A museum dedicated to the works of Symbolist painter Gustave Moreau, housed in his former home and studio.
Moreau (1826-1898) was a French Symbolist painter known for his visionary and mystical works; he was inspired by mythology, biblical stories, and literary sources. His works are typcially richly detailed and often featured exotic and fantastical elements, combining classical themes with a sense of mystery and symbolism. His meticulous technique and use of vibrant colour also contribute to the dreamlike quality of his art.
He had a significant impact on the Symbolist movement, influencing artists such as Odilon Redon and Pierre Puvis de Chavannes.

Provence
Provence, France
Destination guide
Provence is Franceâs Mediterranean dreamland, where itâs almost impossible to avoid magnificent landscapes of sunflowers, lavender, vines, cypresses and olive groves â scenes that are dreamily familiar thanks to once-local artists such as Van Gogh or Cezanne.
Beyond its beauty and artistic heritage, the region also excels in outstanding Roman and medieval monuments; cool cities full of hip boutiques, superb restaurants and cafÃ©s; and a world-class summer festival scene. Itâs a place to go wine tasting, to cycle or hike through some of Franceâs loveliest countryside, or to gallop on horseback through flocks of pink flamingos.
Note from Matt: this guide centres on ‘rural’ Provence, around the towns of Arles, Avignon and Aix-en-Provence, and does not include The French Riviera on Provence’s southern coast. Although technically within the region of ‘Provence’, it’s a very different place and in my view a different destination worth a separate guide. You can see our round-up of the 50+ best things to do in The French Riviera here.

Palace of the Popes
Avignon, Provence, France
Bucket List Experience
When the popes abandoned tumultuous Rome in 1309, they came to Avignon. Seven reigned here until 1377, in a colourful period of greed and depravity that the poet Petrarch labelled the âBabylonian captivityâ. They left behind nothing less than the biggest Gothic palace of all time, built for luxury as well as defence.
Although much of its decoration has been lost over time, it has lost none of its power to amaze. It’s a big site not really suited to younger children, though ‘Les Luminessences’ â an outdoor 3D show, held every evening from mid-August to late September â is good for all the family.

Arles Amphitheatre
Arles, Provence, France
Bucket List Experience
Set on a low hill, this is the biggest and one of the best-preserved RomanÂ amphitheatresÂ in France, where 20,000 would come to watch gladiators fight to the death.
Built in the late 1st century AD, it was inspired by Romeâs Coliseum, which had been built a decade earlier – and was later converted into a fortress in the Middle Ages (an era from which three towers still survive).Â Originally theÂ amphitheatreÂ had aÂ thirdÂ level of arcades, but even now there are lovely views over the rosy tile rooms of Arles from the top level.
A designated UNESCO World Heritage Site, itâs now used as an arena again, itâs used for bullfights during Arlesâ Easter and September festivals, as well as the bloodless Courses Camarguaises bullfights, and occasional gladiatorial re-enactments.
Be sure to visit the ancient theatre, too, which is included in the ticket â built in the century before the amphitheatre, itâs not as well-preserved, but still used for performances.

Cezanneâs Studio

Cezanneâs studio on Les Lauves hill was designed by the artist himself in 1902, although he only used it when it was too cold to paint outdoors (he died in 1906, after getting caught in the rain while painting his beloved Mont Sainte-Victoire). Over the decades it has been maintained as he left it â a must-see for any Cezanne fan, the one place in Aix where his presence is tangible.
If you continue another kilometre or so north from the studio, along Avenue Paul Cezanne, youâll come to Les Lauves, the Terrain des Peintures viewpoint â where Cezanne often planted his easel to paint Mont Sainte-Victoire.

The Luberon [driving & cycling]
Luberon, Provence, France

The Luberon in southeast Provence is a 600 square kilometres (230 sq mi) massif, consisting of three intersecting mountain ranges. With achingly beautiful landscapes, mesmerising fields of lavender, stipey vineyards, quaint hilltop villages and lively markets, itâs quintessential Provence at its most charming, traditional and picturesque.
The easiest way to explore it is to take an organised tour, or if you prefer to go independent, rent or bring a car and drive between scenic points. Make a circular tour, starting in LâIsle-sur-la-Sorgue with its canals, waterwheels and antiques shops; then visit the mysterious source at the Fontaine-de-Vaucluse, before heading to golden stone Gordes, with its curious field of boriesÂ (stone igloo huts) and its lavender-growing Cistercian abbey,Â SÃ©nanque.Â Finally, head to Roussillon, with its dramatic ochre quarries, and three neighbouring villages â some of Provenceâs prettiest – Bonnieux, Lacoste and MÃ©nerbes. If you have the time, stay along the way, and make it a road trip.
You can also tour by bike: there are numerous shorter routes, and a full 8-day, 240km circuit – called the Luberon a velo – that winds through the most beautiful parts of the region, along old country roads.

Van Gogh Walk in Saint-Remy
Saint-Remy-de-Provence, Provence, France
Bucket List Experience
VincentÂ Van Gogh moved to Provence in 1888, during a time of ill health. He fell in love with the landscape and the rich light, and decided to stay and try to set up an artists’ colony.
Initially, he settled in Arles, where he created over 300 paintings and drawings, some of his best-known works â including the famous ‘Sunflowers’ paintings (now held in the NeueÂ PinakothekÂ in Munich,Â National GalleryÂ in London, Philadelphia Museum of Art,Â Van Gogh MuseumÂ in Amsterdam and the Sompo Japan Museum of Art in Tokyo).
The following yearÂ however,Â in 1889,Â after a bout of poor mental health, Van Gogh committed himself to the St-Paul-de-MausoleÂ asylum just outside Saint-Remy. ThereÂ heÂ paintedÂ more of his masterpieces, includingÂ The Starry Night, now displayed inÂ New Yorkâs Museum of Modern Art (MoMA).
As prime spots where Van Gogh lived and painted, the towns of Arles and Saint-Remy both regret not hanging on to any of Van Goghâs original works while he was alive. To make up for it, each has set up a self-guided Van Gogh Walk, pinpointing the scenic spots where the master planted his easel.

Courses Camarguaises
Arles, Provence, France
Bucket List Experience
CoursesÂ CamarguaisesÂ are bloodless bullfights, unique to Provence, whereÂ razeteursÂ (young men) dressed in white compete to seize a cockade, tied between the horns of a bull. Their only defense is to vault over the boards whenever the bull charges.
Unlike in bullfighting, the bulls are the stars of the show, not the âbullfightersâ i.e. razeteurs, even though some razeteurs achieve some local fame and notoriety. Each bull has his own name and identity â some become local âheroesâ, with long âcareersâ and even secure an honoury statue. The Camargue bull breed has long been recognised and valued for their speed, spirit, intelligence and fighting prowess (much more than their work ethic), and are specially bred for the occasion.
There are numerous such âCoursesâ held through the spring and summer months, many accompanying various Provence festivals, but the âbig oneâ, the main event, is theÂ Cocarde dâOrÂ that takes place on the first Monday in July.Â The tournament is staged in theÂ evocative setting ofÂ LesÂ ArÃ¨nes, Arlesâ ancient RomanÂ amphitheatre, and includes aÂ colourfulÂ parade of traditional costumes. Not only is the bestÂ razeteurÂ crowned, but the bravest bull is chosen as well â a greatÂ honourÂ for itsÂ manadeÂ (ranch).
Because this is a bloodless sport, it’s a great way of getting a taste of the tradition of bullfighting, without the gore.Â Itâs also an opportunity toÂ experience a culturalÂ phenomenonÂ in a magnificent Roman setting.

Lavender in Provence
Provence, France
Bucket List Experience
When people think of ‘Provence’, they’ll think of medieval villages, rich culture, exceptional food and… lavender. Vast fields of it, smothering the rolling landscapes like a purple carpet.
Locals in Provence have been cultivating lavender for centuries, using it for a variety of purposes. It’s distilled into an essential oil, which is then used as an ingredient in perfumes, cosmetics, and aromatherapy products. It’s also used in traditional Provencal sachets to scent linens and wardrobes, and in local dishes to add a unique flavour. (There’s even lavender ice cream). Lavender is also known for its medicinal properties, such as soothing burns, relieving headaches, and aiding sleep.
Lavender thrives in Provence due to its ideal climate, characterised by abundant sunshine, well-drained soils, and altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters. No wonder, then, that lavender is deeply rooted in the region’s culture and economy.
The most famous locations for lavender gazing are the Valensole Plateau, Sault, and the Luberon region. The fields bloom from late June to early August, so you need to go then for the full immersive experience.
To learn about cultivation and distillation, head to the Lavandes Angelvin Estate in Valensole, where they’ll tell you all about it in the onsite shop, and stock a range of lavender-themed products. Another good adoption is the Blue Provence Distillery which offers free tours of their facility. Also, be sure to stop by the elegantly beautiful Abbaye Notre-Dame de Senanque, the subject of the classic Provence ‘lavender’ photo.

Provenceâs best food & drink
Provence, France
Bucket List Experience
Provence is celebrated for its exceptional food and drink, deeply rooted in the region’s rich culinary traditions and Mediterranean climate. The cuisine is characterised by its vibrant flavours, aromatic herbs, and the use of fresh, local produce.
The Provencal diet heavily features ingredients like tomatoes, garlic, onions, bell peppers, zucchini, and eggplant, all of which thrive in the sun-drenched climate of southeastern France. Olive oil, often referred to as ‘liquid gold’, is a staple in Provencal cooking, infusing dishes with its rich, fruity flavour. Herbs such as thyme, rosemary, basil, and oregano are integral to the cuisine, often combined to create the iconic Herbes de Provence mix. These aromatic herbs enhance the natural flavours of the ingredients, highlighting the region’s emphasis on simplicity and freshness.
Cooking styles in Provence range from slow-simmering stews that meld flavours over time to quick, vibrant sautÃ©s that preserve the crispness and colour of vegetables. Grilling is also popular, particularly for fish and meats, taking advantage of the region’s abundant coastline and access to fresh seafood.
The region’s wine, particularly rosÃ©, complements the cuisine perfectly. Local wineries produce wines that pair beautifully with Provencal dishes, enhancing the dining experience.

Roman Theatre of Orange
Orange, Provence, France
Bucket List Experience
Roman theatres have survived across the Mediterranean, but few can match the glorious one in Orange, where the massive stage wall (much admired by Louis XIV) has survived intact.
Built early in the 1st century AD, itâs one of the best-preserved Ancient Roman theatres in the world and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It served as a venue for theatre and spectacles until the 4th century AD, when Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire and the Church shut it down, believing the spectacles to be unholy.
Today up to 10,000 spectators can still sit and enjoy its pitch-perfect ancient acoustics, under the watchful eye of a statue of Augustus, when itâs used for live performances including summerâs fabulous Les Choregies d’Orange opera festival. A ticket to the ancient theatre includes admission to the MusÃ©e dâOrange (Museum of Orange), which contains archaeological finds and paintings from the area.

Teetering atop the craggyÂ AlpillesÂ mountains,Â this once-impressive fortressÂ was built in the 10th century to be the home ofÂ theÂ Seigneurs deÂ BauxÂ (Lords ofÂ Baux),Â the meanest, toughestÂ hombresÂ in Provence during the Middle Ages.
For five hundred years it presided over ceaseless conflictsÂ – but its court was just as famous for promoting courtly love and troubadours during that era.Â It was eventually ordered to be demolished by King Louis XIII, as part of his relentless campaign to suppress religious and feudal rebellion.

Truffle hunting in Provence
Cadenet, Provence, France

Truffles in Provence are prized fungi known for their earthy aroma and rich flavour. They grow in the region’s limestone-rich soil and mild climate, often found near oak trees. Used in gourmet cooking, truffles enhance dishes with their unique taste.

French Riviera
Cote d'Azur, France
Destination guide
Money, glamour and bombshell looks: the yacht-magnet, beach-club-trimmed Cote dâAzur, aka The French Riviera, still lives up to the hype as a playground for the worldâs elite.
Home to fabled luxury hotels, triple-starred Michelin restaurants, world-class art museums, hedonistic beaches and celebrity-haunted clubs â as well as the glitzy Cannes Film Festival and Monaco Grand Prix â everything here feels A-list. But alongside the razzle-dazzle, this stretch of Provencal coast in the South of France also offers breathtaking natural beauty and the same bohemian, Mediterranean joie de vivre that attracted Matisse, Picasso and company in decades past.

Monaco Grand Prix
Monaco, Cote d'Azur, France
Bucket List Experience
First run by the local automobile club in 1929, the Monaco Grand Prix is like no other race on the Formula 1 circuit: a heady cocktail of money, bling and VIPs, combined with the adrenaline-packed insanity of cars racing past mega yachts, around tight bends, through a tunnel and the steep streets of a densely packed city.
Because it is so dangerous, itâs shorter and slower than other F1 races, and often yields unexpected results. Some call it a driversâ race (many drivers live in tax-haven Monaco) as itâs actually the least viewer-friendly of all F1 races â although for many diehard fans, thatâs the attraction. Ideally, youâll want access to a television to see whatâs happening on the rest of the track.

Monte Carlo Casino
Monaco, Cote d'Azur, France
Bucket List Experience
Monaco, a playground of the rich and famous, is world-renowned for its casinos; theyâre integral to life and culture here.

Opened in 1863, the worldâs most famous and prestigious casino oozes glamour, history, and surprisingly for a casino, class. The setting is ornate and grand, the (uber-wealthy) clientele wear tuxedos and cocktail dresses, gentle applause replaces whooping and hollering. James Bond visited twice â once in Never Say Never Again and again in GoldenEye.
Between 10am and 12.15pm you can buy a ticket to visit the legendary gaming rooms with an audio guide. After 2pm, anyone in proper attire with photo ID aged 18 and over can enter the three main gaming rooms for a fee;Â  or play the slot machines for free in the Salle Renaissance.

Too tame? Then get egged and floured at the anarchic Carnaval Populaire in Place Garibaldi. On the final night â always a Wednesday â the Carnival ends with a big firework display and a bonfire of floats on the beach, both of which are free to watch.

World-class art in Nice
Nice, Cote d'Azur, France
Bucket List Experience
Nice can rightly claim Franceâs best hoard of modern art after Parisâs â and much of it was created here, in the early 20th century, when the Rivieraâs light, colour and warmth attracted artists such as Renoir, MatisseÂ and Chagall.
Wealthy collectors later founded museums, often in charming and historic buildings, and many artists donated works to their adopted towns. Just outside of Nice’s borders you’ll find museums dedicated to other world-renowned artists such as Picasso, Bonnard and Cocteau.
Being far less busy than Parisâs art museums, theyâre a pleasure to wander â often set in pretty sculpture gardens, with lovely cafes or wine bars attached so you can sit and ruminate on your art fix.

Drive the Grande Corniche
Eze, Cote d'Azur, France

If you want to understand the process first-hand, sign up for a perfume-creating workshop, where you get to create your own 100ml bottle under the watchful gaze of a professional.
Although Fragonard is the most charming, Grasseâs other parfumeries, such as GalimardÂ and Molinard are also worth a stop. Molinard’s perfume-making workshops help you to create your own scent, guided by a professional ânoseâ. Options range from 30 mins to 2 hours.

5 best beaches of the French Riviera
Cote d'Azur, France
Bucket List Experience
The Cote dâAzur is famous for its rugged Mediterranean beauty, though beaches are pebblier and more shingly than pristine sand. There are some exceptions, though (see Pampelonne and Juan Les Pins) and even the craggiest bays have sparkling shallows in that turquoise Mediterranean hue.
The most scenic stretches are dominated by lavish, luxury beach clubs, charging visitors anywhere from Â£15 and Â£40 to rent a sun lounger, towel and parasol â but the people-watching and sense of glamour are priceless.
The best beach clubs, around Saint-Tropez, Antibes, Cannes and Cap Ferrat, offer slick food and drink service, brought directly to your lounger â and often turn into late-night party venues. Hedonistic Saint-Tropez, with its golden beaches, is the most famous place to soak up this scene.

Matisse Museum
Nice, Cote d'Azur, France

World-renowned French artists Henri Matisse, like Picasso, is credited with revolutionising the visual arts in the 20th century. Many of his best works were painted at the turn of the 20th century, using his unique blend of intense colour, flattened form and decorative pattern.
Set in a grand 17th-century Genoese mansion, Niceâs Matisse Museum opened in 1963, containing works that Matisse left to his adopted city, where he lived from 1917 to 1954.
It isnât focused heavily on his most famous works â instead, youâll see how the artistâs style evolved over the years: touching on his bold, colourful paintings, gouache cut-outs, drawings, prints, and 57 sculptures (nearly all of his output). Steps lead down to the modern wing, built atop the cityâs Roman ruins.

The highlight is the Eileen Gray E-1027 House, the Modernist masterpiece (1929) of the famous Irish designer and her partner, Jean Badovici.
The Promenade then takes in sumptuous Mediterranean foliage along the white rocky coastline, with glimpses of fabulous villas and views of Monaco.

Walk The Chemin Nietzsche
Eze, Cote d'Azur, France
Experience
The philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche famously walked up this beautiful, zigzagging path â and was inspired to finish Thus Spake Zarathustra in the process â but most non-philosophers prefer the views (and effort levels) when walking down.
This route stretches from the dramatic village perche of Eze to the train station in seaside Eze-Bord-du-Mer, covering 1.6km and a 400m decline, and takes the average walker just under an hour to descend. Itâs more like an hour and a half to hike the trail upwards â either way, the path is well signposted. For the best views, start or finish at Ezeâs succulent-filled Jardin Exotique at the top of the medieval village.

Tuscany
Tuscany, Italy
Destination guide
Itâs not difficult to see why Tuscany is one of Italyâs (indeed, Europeâs) most popular holiday destinations. The region has it all: treasure-filled art cities and postcard-pretty hill towns, a long sandy coastline, high mountains and gently rolling hills plus superb food and wine with a thriving restaurant scene.
Even leaving aside Florence, thereâs enough art to keep culture vultures busy for weeks, while outdoors-y types can dive into a whole range of activities.
Add a plethora of fabulous hotels (from agrotourism stays to boutique heritage boltholes and five-star grand dames set in converted castles), and you have all the ingredients of an unforgettable, soul-enriching holiday.

Leaning Tower of Pisa
Pisa, Tuscany, Italy
Bucket List Experience
One of Italyâs most popular sights, this astonishingly beautiful belltower dates back to 1173. An architectural marvel at the time, the tower was doomed from the outset, having been built on unstable sand and clay.
It began to lean once the third storey was completed; work was suspended for a hundred years, with the tower only being completed in the late 14th century. It housed seven bells, one for each musical note, and eventually reached a height of just over 58m.
In 1993, at 15 feet off the vertical, the tower seemed so close to collapse that an expensive rescue bid was made involving vast counterweights, steel cables and lots of digging. It worked to a degree; the building is once again safe and open to the public (but with enough lean to keep the hordes coming).
The still-famously titling tower still attracts millions of visitors a year, for the unnerving climb up its 293 steps.

Palio di Siena
Siena, Tuscany, Italy
Bucket List Experience
The most famous bareback horserace in the world, Il Palio sees horses and riders galloping three times round Sienaâs glorious, medieval Piazza del Campo.
Palio is a centuries-old settling of neighbourhood scores for the Sienese, and it defines the social, cultural and political fabric of the city each year. Each of the 17 contrade (neighbourhoods) enters a horse and jockey (although only 10 compete in each race) with the single objective to win by fair means or â occasionally â foul.
The race itself is over in a flash (an average of 75 seconds), but itâs preceded by several hours of processions and three days of pre-race trials and festivities. Each contrada holds its own festivities (al fresco dinners, the blessing of the horses in the contrada churches) in the three days leading up to the races.

Chianti Wine Region
Chianti, Tuscany, Italy
Bucket List Experience
Some of Italyâs best wines are produced in the DOCG Chianti Classico, 177,500 acres of undulating, vine-striped land stretching between Florence and Siena. Dozens of wine estates share this fertile terroir, many of which offer tastings and vineyard tours and an opportunity to buy wines from source. Some also have very good restaurants and accommodation.
The history of wine-making in the region dates back hundreds of years. Early Chiantis were a blend of Sangiovese, Canaiolo and Malvasia Bianca grapes; today, a DOC Chianti must be made with at least 80% Sangiovese.
The main Chianti growing area is divided into eight sub-zones. The most famous is Chianti Classico, located between Florence and Siena, which produces some 25 million bottles a year, including some of the regionâs greatest wines. Most bottles sport the image of a black rooster on a gold background, a guarantee of quality.

World-class art in Florence
Florence, Tuscany, Italy
Bucket List Experience
With around a million paintings, frescoes and sculptures, Florence harbours the worldâs densest concentration of Renaissance art (and not only), remarkable for both the sheer volume of work contained within its walls, but also for the quality; expect to see masterpieces by the likes of Giotto, Masaccio, the Lippis, Leonardo and Michelangelo.
Exactly why this ârebirthâ occurred in Florence is a matter for debate, but wealthy patrons such as the ruling Medicis, along with the presence of outstanding artistic talents and the 15th-century thirst for knowledge, certainly helped.

Accademia Gallery, Florence
Florence, Tuscany, Italy
Bucket List Experience
Florenceâs other big-name art museum (with the Uffizi) has a world-class collection of 14th- and 15th-century art, but those endless queues of people are really here to see one thing: Michelangeloâs 1504 4m-high statue of David.
Moved here in 1873 from Piazza della Signoria, the iconic sculpture appears quite different in the flesh: the head and hands are larger than expected (a trick of perspective; originally the statue was placed higher up).
Walk around the back to see Davidâs sling, a tree stump â and those famous buttocks.

Florenceâs must-see Renaissance architecture
Florence, Tuscany, Italy
Bucket List Experience
Florence is known as the cradle of the Renaissance and is home to a wealth of buildings belonging to that era. Lavish Romanesque and Gothic styles were fashionable in the 11th â 13th centuries, before an early Renaissance style emerged in the early 15th century.
The centre of Florence is filled with palaces, churches and monuments defining this movement which was characterised by a classical sensibility with pilasters, columns, arches and pediments and strictly mathematical proportions.
The three architects who dominated the period were Brunelleschi, Michelozzo and Alberti while Michelangelo became one of the most important architects of the High Renaissance.

Florenceâs art-filled churches and chapels
Florence, Tuscany, Italy
Bucket List Experience
Many of Florenceâs religious buildings were constructed between the 11th and 13th centuries, but few have remained untainted by later additions. During Renaissance times, wealthy families such as the ruling Medicis commissioned the finest artists to fresco family chapels, carve tombs for loved ones, update architectural structures and create bespoke works of art.
Step into any Florentine church today and youâll find an extraordinary legacy of art treasures by masters such as Giotto, Masaccio, the Lippis and Michelangelo.

A day in the Val dâOrcia
Val d'Orcia, Tuscany, Italy
Bucket List Experience
The UNESCO-protected Val dâOrcia is one of the most beautiful areas of Tuscany, a ravishing expanse of open, undulating farmland broken by cypresses in soldier-straight lines and dominated by Monte Amiata, an extinct volcano.
Atmospheric hill-top towns dot the countryside, many dating back to medieval times, when settlements were built on outcrops of rock or hill summits; both easier to protect and harder to invade.
Pottering between two of three of the towns is a glorious way to spend a day; Pienza and Montepulciano are the biggest draws, but other highlights include the spa village of Bagno Vignoni â where a thermal pool takes the place of the central piazza â and San Quirico dâOrcia, with its magnificent Collegiata church. Close to Montepulciano is Villa La Foce, with a beautiful garden open to visitors.
Unpaved white roads link many of the smaller villages in the area, making this ideal walking and cycling country. Weaving through these unspoilt landscapes on either foot or two wheels is a fabulous way to appreciate some of the most beautiful rural landscapes in Italy.

Field of Miracles
Pisa, Tuscany, Italy
Bucket List Experience
Pisaâs so-called âField of Miraclesâ (Campo dei Miracoli) is an elegant complex of monumental, unique buildings set on a wide green lawn just inside the northern city walls. It encompasses the iconic Leaning Tower, the Cathedral, the Baptistery and the Campo Santo.
First constructed was the huge Romanesque Cathedral, begun in 1063, with an intricately-tiered marble faÃ§ade. Then came the Baptistery (1152), the biggest of its kind in Italy; it has a magnificent pulpit by Nicola Pisano. Building started on the emblematic Leaning Tower (a bell tower) in 1173, and it almost immediately began to lean.
Finally came the Camposanto (âHoly Fieldâ) cemetery, a roofless rectangle of gleaming white marble begun in 1277. It was once adorned with fabulous frescoes by Benozzo Gozzoli, but Allied bombing in 1944 caused the roof to collapse all but destroying them; today just fragments remain.
This is one of the most visited sites in Tuscany, although most people have their sights set on the Leaning Tower.

Tuscanyâs best food & drink
Tuscany, Italy
Bucket List Experience
Tuscan cooking is recognised as being among the best regional cuisines in Italy, yet itâs based on the concept of cucina povera (humble cooking) and on modest ingredients.
Traditional Tuscan cuisine is hearty and rustic, and based on simple ingredients such as bread, pulses, meat and poultry, fresh veg and olive oil, all prepared with the minimum of fuss. Close to the coast, youâll find more fish and seafood, but again, recipes are simple.
Tuscan red wines are highly-respected throughout the world. A local trattoria will usually offer a perfectly drinkable, cheap and cheerful house wine (red is a better bet) sold by the litre. More sophisticated regional wines to try include Brunello, Chianti Classico and Vino Nobile.

Truffles in Tuscany
Tuscany, Italy
Bucket List Experience
Of all the food and wine ingredients indigenous to Tuscany, the white truffle is probably the most highly-prized â yet itâs one of those things that you will either love or hate; it has a heady yet strange, earthy, musky aroma and a delicate flavour that lends itself particularly well to eggs and buttery tagliolini pasta
Different types of truffles grow year-round in Tuscany and in various areas, the most prolific of which are San Miniato, the Mugello and the Crete Senese. They are, however, elusive. White truffles will only thrive in just the right conditions, growing on the roots of trees and normally hidden by layers of damp leaves and earth.
A truffle hunt with an expert trifulau (truffle hunter) and his dog is a compelling way to discover how the truffle-hunting world works. The stakes are high â white truffles sell for huge amounts of money. In 2007, a 1.28kg tuber sold at auction in the US for an astonishing $330,000.
The most highly prized of Tuscanyâs rich food harvest, the white truffle is also the most elusive. An expert-led truffle hunt is an ideal way to discover and taste these extraordinary tubers.

Florenceâs best food & drink
Florence, Tuscany, Italy
Bucket List Experience
The Florentines are quite traditional in what they eat and justly proud of their local cuisine which is hearty, rustic, and based on simple ingredients such as bread, pulses, meat and poultry, fresh veg and olive oil, all prepared with the minimum of fuss. Typical seasonal ingredients include artichokes and porcini mushrooms, wild boar, rabbit, pork, game and excellent beef.
Wash it down with one of the robust local red wines; Tuscany is Italyâs premier wine-growing region producing from Chianti Classico in the hills between Florence and Siena to the highly-rated (and highly-priced) Super Tuscans from the Bolgheri zone on the coast.
Meals are traditionally divided into antipasti (starters), primi (soup, pasta), secondi (meat, fish) and dolce (dessert).

Natural spas and hot springs in Tuscany
Tuscany, Italy
Bucket List Experience
Tuscany is full of natural hot springs or terme, many of which date from Roman or even Etruscan times and whose waters, originating from deep within the earthâs crust and emerging at around 35Â°C-37Â°C, have long been known to have therapeutic properties.
Each spring has a different combination of minerals and gases, so different terme are said to be beneficial for different conditions. Carbon dioxide boosts the immune system, for example, and sulfur-rich water is believed to benefit muscular and arthritic pain.
Hotels, some with day spas, have been developed around many of these springs, and while some are fairly modest, others have turned into luxury spa resorts offering first-class accommodation and a myriad of treatments (both medicinal and cosmetic) to compliment the thermal waters.

A day in Siena
Siena, Tuscany, Italy
Bucket List Experience
According to many of its citizens, Siena is the most perfect medieval city in the world. A glorious ensemble of red brick buildings and exquisite monuments, itâs famous for its fan-shaped Campo and the twice-yearly Il Palio horse race.
Any visit to the city should begin in the sloping Piazza del Campo, the cityâs main square, fringed with cafes that are perfect for a doppio espresso and a spot of people-watching. The square is dominated by the Mangia Tower and the Palazzo Pubblico â and climbing the tower is a great way to start your visit, giving wraparound views of the city and surrounding countryside.
The old town is relatively compact and the best way to explore is simply by strolling through the ancient streets and alleyways.

Lucca is a compact gem of a town, a perfect ensemble of Medieval and Renaissance buildings enclosed by a well-preserved set of 16th-century walls.

Its overall attraction lies in the fact that it never feels overwhelmed by tourists, thus offering an authentic sense of local life.
A coffee in oval Piazza del Anfiteatro (built on the site of the Roman amphitheatre) is a good place to start a tour of the town. There are some wonderful old shops with their original storefronts in and around nearby Via Fillungo.
Historic, atmospheric CaffÃ¨ di Simo (Via Fillungo 58) is another good place for a cappuccino and a pastry while the Buca di SantâAntonio restaurant (open since 1782, Via della Cervia 3) serves up Lucchese specialities with a modern twist.

Boat tours on a traditional barchetto

Sometimes dubbed the medieval Manhattan for its clutch of slim towers (visible for miles around), iconic San Gimignano is Tuscanyâs most famous (and most visited) hill town. Arguably over-restored, it is nonetheless achingly pretty, a set piece of medieval palazzi, graceful piazze, narrow streets and the aforementioned towers â of which only 14 survive of an original 72.
A good way to start a visit is by climbing the 218 steps of the Torre Grossa for an overview of the town and its jumble of red rooftops. Then wander the Piazza della Cisterna (containing the townâs old well) and Piazza del Duomo â both are lovely, the latter lined with impressive palazzi.

Etruscan history in  Tuscany
Tuscany, Italy
Bucket List Experience
Built from tuff rock and founded by the Etruscans in the 8th century BC, Pitigliano, Sorano and Sovana are a fascinating trio of towns set in a remote south-eastern corner of Tuscany. Evidence of the Etruscans is all over the area in local museum collections, the many necropoli and the mysterious Vie Cave.
Pitigliano, built on sheer cliffs, eventually passed into the hands of the Medici; a Jewish ghetto was established here in 1608, relics of which can still be seen today. The Archaeological Museum houses a haul of local Etruscan finds.
The heyday of Sovana came in the 13th century under the Aldobrandeschi family who built the now-ruined castle. A gem of a village, it has an impressive 12th-century town hall and a lovely Romanesque Duomo.
Cliff-top Sorano is reached via a dramatic road that winds in and out of deep gorges. The old town is partly derelict thanks to a series of landslides; its charming, quiet lanes are dotted with artistsâ studios and workshops.
The precise purpose of the mysterious Etruscan walkways known as the vie cave (passageways gouged into the tuff rock) is not clear, but a walk through one of these deep channels, some of which are 20m deep and a kilometre long, is a memorable experience. The most famous are the Cavone, Poggio Prisca and San Sebastiano near Pitigliano.

Venice
Veneto, Italy
Destination guide
La Serenissima is one of the worldâs great romantic destinations, a unique and exotic city built on water by architects who looked to Constantinople, Cairo and Aleppo rather than Rome or Florence.
Home to some of the worldâs finest painters â Bellini, Titian, Tintoretto â barely a church is without a masterpiece. Yet so spectacular is the city with its narrow calle (streets) and quiet campi (squares), polychrome marble palaces and gondola-dotted canals, itâs a pleasure just to wander and observe.
Whatâs more, Venice is no mere floating museum; the Biennale and Punta della Dogana contemporary art centre add a thoroughly 21st-century vibe.

St Markâs Basilica
Venice, Veneto, Italy
Bucket List Experience
Surely the most exquisite place of worship in Italy, St Markâs is a cathedral built to satisfy the wildest dreams of the Doges.
Built in the 11th century to house the alleged remains of St Mark, its Byzantine mosaics, Gothic carvings and sumptuous treasures were accumulated during many centuries of Venetian trading and looting.
From the Pala dâOro (jewel-encrusted altarpiece, made in Costantinopoli in 976) to its wealth of sculptures and magnificent bronze horses rearing over the piazza, its OTT opulence, both inside and out, it is a testament to La Serenissimaâs power and might.

Carnevale (Venice Carnival)

Dating back almost a thousand years, the Venetian Carnival (or Carnevale) is a two-week estravanganza of dressing up, partying and posing enjoyed by Â Venetians and tourists alike.
Carnevale enjoyed its heyday in the 18th century when it became popular as a pagan festival. It was revived in the 1970s when the city administrators realised it could still draw the crowds (and bring in the cash), and it worked; today tens of thousands flock to the city each year from round the world for the spectacle.
For two weeks in February each year, the streets of Venice fill with people wearing masks and elaborate masquerade costumes. The original purpose of the costumes and masks is thought to have originally been to hide the wearerâs identity, removing social differences and allowing them to engage is less reputable practices.

Boat trip down the Grand Canal
Venice, Veneto, Italy
Bucket List Experience
To all intents and purposes, the Grand Canal (or Canal Grande) is Veniceâs high street, a wide thoroughfare lined with elegant palazzi that winds through the city. Like any high street, it is full of traffic (water buses, ambulances, builderâs barges, gondolas and private boats) and is essential to Venetian life.
Two miles long, and traversed by four bridges, the Canal flows between the train station and St. Mark’s Square (Piazza San Marco). Between the 12th and 18th centuries, every important Venetian family built a palazzo (often called a Caâ) on its banks, each with a water entrance. The most notable palazzi include; Caâ dâOro, Caâ Pesaro, Caâ Foscari, Caâ Rezzonico and Palazzo Grimani.
The cheapest boat ride is to hop on one of the regular water buses (vaporetto) that ply the Canal from one end to the other. Progress is slow, and they are often crowded, but a sought-after open-air seat at either the front or the back allows you to see everything. For a more exclusive experience, and to up the glamour stakes, take a water taxi or a gondola.

Cicchetti Crawl
Venice, Veneto, Italy
Bucket List Experience
Cicchetti are Venetian tapas, tasty morsels to whet the appetite and soak up a glass of wine or two. They are traditionally served in a bacaro (wine bar), which also offers wines by the glass; Venetians eat cichetti before lunch or dinner, usually standing at the bar. A plate of cicchetti is one of the cheapest ways to fill up in this expensive city; 6 or 7 make a light meal, and at an average price of â¬2, along with a glass of inexpensive local wine, thatâs a bargain.
A fun way to enjoy this tradition is to plan a tour of different bacari, tasting a couple of cicchetti in each. Expect polpette (fried meat balls), baccalÃ  mantecato (creamed salt cod), a whole variety of weird and wonderful seafood, and lots more.

Peggy Guggenheim Collection
Venice, Veneto, Italy
Bucket List Experience
The unfinished, one-storey Palazzo Venier dei Leoni was the home of eccentric American millionairess Peggy Guggenheim and today still houses her extraordinary collection of modern art.
Guggenheim brought her collection of mainly surrealist and modernist works to Venice in 1949 purchasing the charming Grand Canal-side palazzo to house it and herself. She died here in 1979 aged 81.
From Picasso to Pollock, Brancusi to Max Ernst, Guggenheimâs brilliantly unfailing eye picked out the best of the 20th-century avant garde; this collection gives the city a modernist stamp it would otherwise have lacked.
Gazing across the Grand Canal, with the rambling sculpture garden overlooked by the cafÃ©, there are few more alluring spots in Venice.

Glass-blowing in Murano
Venice, Veneto, Italy
Bucket List Experience
Murano became the capital of glass in 1291 thanks to a decree banning all furnaces from Venice proper to avoid fire risk. The island soon became centre for glass-blowing, shipping chandeliers, mirrors, vases and glass tableware across the world. Today, Murano remains a unique place where the skills of centuries are still practised by latter-day artisans.
Watching a top glass-blower is an absorbing sight, from the ferocious heat thrown out by the yellow glow of the furnaces to the balletic genius of the Murano craftsmen as they blow, snip, twist and tug at their fiery blob of liquid to transform it into an exquisite vase or seahorse. Afterwards, you can buy pieces in the showrooms.

Itâs huge, and often crowded, but St. Markâs square is one of the most emblematic spots in the city and is lined with over-priced cafÃ©s that offer live music. But out of season, on a foggy winterâs evening or at dawn, itâs undeniably atmospheric.

Venice Biennial of Visual Arts
Venice, Veneto, Italy
Bucket List Experience
La Biennale transforms Venice annually into a surreal blend of ancient-and-contemporary culture unrivalled anywhere else in the world; it attracts giants of the international art world and vast numbers of visitors. The original Biennale (established in 1895) focused on art and is still held in odd years, but in 1980 an architecture equivalent was added in even years.
The annual bonanza divides into two main sections: individual countries have pavilions in the Giardini (Public Gardens) while artists and architects chosen by a curator exhibit within the magnificent spaces of the old Arsenale. The result is a pop-up museum of painting, installation, sculpture, film, new media and architecture that spreads its tentacles across palaces and churches across the city.

Veniceâs islands
Venice, Veneto, Italy
Bucket List Experience
Venice is set in the middle of a lagoon joined to the mainland by a manmade causeway and surrounded by water and 39 islands.
Murano is the best-known island thanks to its glass-blowers, and colourful Burano is the subject of many an Instagram shot, but there are others that are worth exploring, especially if you fancy getting away from it all. Each offers a very different atmosphere; some are all but deserted apart from the odd church, and on others, life seems to continue almost oblivious of the tourist madness just across the lagoon. All are accessible via vaporetto from Venice proper.

Rialto Market
Venice, Veneto, Italy

Basilica of Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari
Venice, Veneto, Italy
Experience
Of all Veniceâs many churches, the huge, barn-like Frari is one of the most art-packed. The Franciscans started on the present Gothic church in 1338 and finished in 1469; it boasts the second-highest bell tower in the city and a severe exterior, but once inside, the quality of the art is extraordinary.
The assault begins as you go in when your eyes are drawn immediately to the High Alter and Titianâs vivid, soaring Assumption. Other works by Titian to look out for include his Madonna di Caâ Pesaro (1519).
The Sacristy contains one of Giovanni Belliniâs greatest paintings, the Madonna and Child with Saints. To the left of the high alter is the fabulous Reniassance tomb of Doge NiccolÃ² Tron (1473) by Antonio Rizzo.

Istanbul
Marmara Region, Turkey
Destination guide
This important, layered city has seen a series of dramatic reincarnations, beginning life as Byzantium (founded c. 660 BC), before being renamed Constantinople in AD 330 (eastern capital of the Roman Empire).
The city finally became known as ‘Stamboul’, or Istanbul, during the Ottoman era, which began in the 15th century when it was captured by the 21-year-old Sultan Mehmed II (aka “Mehmed the Conqueror”), ushering in an era of lavish Sultan-led rule.
In the course of its deliciously rich 1,800-year history, Istanbul has been the capital of three empires. Here East meets West head-on, in a mesmerising, evocative city that its people have always considered the centre of the world.
Yet Istanbul is not just about sightseeing and museums; right now it has as much urban buzz and excitement as any place on earth. Besides making a bold name for itself in art, music, fashion and design, the city is modernising at a breathtaking pace.
The people are lovely, the food is a delight and the city is one of the top shopping destinations on the planet.

Hagia Sophia
Istanbul, Marmara Region, Turkey
Bucket List Experience
A masterpiece of Byzantine architecture, this world-renowned 6th-century marvel encapsulates the essence of the lost Ottoman Empire in stone.
With a great dome and marble columns adorned with frescoes and glittering gold mosaics, the Church of the âHoly Wisdomâ was the last major creation of classical antiquity and the centre of the Byzantine world for 1,000 years. Initially a cathedral, then a mosque, itâs now a museum as well as a functioning mosque â and a must-see in Istanbul.

Dolmabahce Palace
Istanbul, Marmara Region, Turkey
Bucket List Experience
This luxurious, modern âEuropeanâ palace on the banks of the Bosphorus was built on the order of the Ottoman Empire’s 31st Sultan, Abdulmecid I, and was built between the years 1843 and 1856. An extraordinary and unique architectural curiosity, the Dolmabahce blends Ottoman architecture with Baroque, Rococo and Neoclassical details â itâs overwhelming to the point of kitsch, and so lavish that it bankrupted the Empire.
Donât trust the clocks: they all say 9.05, stopped at the hour when the Turkish revolutionary statesman Ataturk died here on 10 November 1938.

Istanbulâs extraordinary Ottoman mosques
Istanbul, Marmara Region, Turkey
Bucket List Experience
After conquering Constantinople, Mehmet the Conqueror converted the Hagia Sophia, the great Byzantine church, into a mosque. By the 1500s, the sultans were transforming Istanbulâs skyline with spectacular granite, marble and tile mosques inspired by the Hagia Sophia â many including complexes of hammams, schools, libraries and markets to fund them.
The legacy was almost 3,000 mosques (more than any other city on earth) of which the magnificent Ottoman imperial mosques â the 17th-century Blue Mosque and Sinanâs Suleymaniye Mosque â are the undoubted stars.
Good for age: 13+

Istanbulâs palaces
Istanbul , Marmara Region, Turkey
Bucket List Experience
In 1453, Mehmet the Conqueror found the old Byzantine Great Palace uninhabitable, so he built a new one â the opulent Topkapi Palace â which set the style and remained the seat of power for centuries.
Other more flamboyant Sultans followed suit, no expense spared, in building their own palaces and monuments. The result was a legacy of 11 extravagant palaces, reaching a dizzying level of crystal chandelier splendour in the Dolmabahce Palace. Some of the palaces are summer houses and mansions, one (the Ciragan Palace) is now a 5-star hotel, but many are retained as museums.

Topkapi Palace

Built in 1459 to become the 15th and 16th-century home of the Ottoman Sultans, this enormous complex became the centre of the Ottoman world. Now itâs a perfectly preserved time capsule of life at the top in this most exotic of empires. Some parts of the palace, especially the harem and the sultansâ private quarters, rank among the finest works of Turkish architecture and art.
The museum holds Ottoman clothing, weapons, armour, miniatures, religious relics, and illuminated manuscripts such as the Topkapi manuscript. The collections the sultans piled up over the centuries â from glittering jewels to Prophet Muhammadâs tooth â are beyond belief.

Built on the orders of Sultan Ahmet I (1603â17) to rival the Hagia Sophia in grandeur and beauty â and completed in 1616, one year before his death â the Blue Mosque (aka Sultan Ahmed Mosque) is considered one of the last great mosques of the classical period, combining Byzantine elements with traditional Islamic architecture.
With six slender minarets and a beautiful dome, it dominates Istanbulâs skyline. The interior is decorated with 21,000 hand-painted (mostly blue) tiles and stunning stained-glass windows.
The whole area around the Blue Mosque was once the site of the Byzantine emperorsâ Great Palace. Some of the palaceâs recently discovered, lavish floor mosaics, dating from AD 450-550, are on display at the Great Palace Mosaic Museum.

Whirling Dervishes of Istanbul
Istanbul, Marmara Region, Turkey
Bucket List Experience
Dressed in long white robes with tall hats symbolising tombstones, members of the Mevlevi order (more popularly known as whirling dervishes) are followers of the 13th-century mystic Mevlana Rumi, who would spin into ecstatic circles overcome by his love for God.
The sema ceremony recalls Rumiâs spiritual journey as the dervishes whirl to the Sufiâs haunting, hypnotic music. UNESCO recently placed the dervishes on its Intangible Heritage of Humanity list.
The Hodjapasha Culture Center, an Istanbul cultural centre housed in a 15th-century bathhouse, stages a haunting semaÂ of dervishes whirling to a classical Turkish orchestra, and other traditional dances from across Anatolia.
Dances of Colours perform traditional semas in an equally authentic setting: the 19th-century home of dervish Ismail Dede Efendi.

World-class art in Istanbul
Istanbul, Marmara Region, Turkey
Bucket List Experience
Its centuries as an imperial capital have also left it some extraordinary historical art to seek out â the gorgeous mosaics in the Chora and Grand Palace museums from the Byzantine era, and from Ottoman times, a hoard of beautiful things: miniatures, glass and metalwork, carved and inlaid woodwork, colour-drenched tiles, ebru (paper marbling) rugs and calligraphy. The Topkapi Palace offers a compelling intro, but itâs well worthwhile seeking out the art in Istanbulâs museums.
But in recent decades, a young, vibrant Istanbul has become a world-class centre for contemporary art too, with several new museums, as well as the Biennale and Istanbul Contemporary art fairs, creating a unique and enticing blend of old-meets-new.

Istanbulâs best food & drink
Istanbul, Marmara Region, Turkey
Bucket List Experience
Turkish cuisine is one of the worldâs finest, and Istanbul has always been the best place to eat it. Today itâs the epicentre of the slow-food-style New Anatolian Kitchen movement, led by celebrity chef Mehmet Gurs â discovering, reviving and riffing off thousands of nearly-forgotten dishes and ingredients from across Turkey.
Dishes are fresh and unfussy, served with the local olive oil, garlic, and tomatoes. Expect plenty of seafood, especially golden fried anchovies, and cured hams and lamb dishes.
Turkish food is ideal for vegetarians, with many of the meze dishes (cold and hot starters) based around yoghurt, aubergine and vegetables, with lots of fresh herbs, including mint, dill and parsley. The traditional accompaniment to a meal is raki, an aniseed-flavoured drink, rather like ouzo, which should be mixed with water and ice.

The countryâs west â where the Nazca lines are found â is dune-rolling desert; the centre rises to glacier-covered Andean peaks with fabulous hiking. To the east, the mountains drop into lush foothills teeming with wildlife â this is where Machu Picchu and the ruins of the Inca Empire are situated. Beyond is the giant Amazon rainforest.
Visits inevitably pass through Peruâs capital and international travel hub, Lima which has some fascinating Spanish colonial buildings and some of the best restaurants in Latin America.

Machu Picchu
Aguas Calientes, Cusco Region, Peru
Bucket List Experience
Even if youâve seen the view in a thousand pictures, you will be blown away:Â cloudsÂ drifting upÂ theÂ lushÂ valley,Â the newly-risen sun burning them awayÂ and drawing the veil from the face of Huayna PicchuÂ mountainÂ and the cascade ofÂ ruin-strewnÂ terraces below.
Welcome to one of South Americaâs most iconic sights: the remarkable Inca citadel that lay undisturbed for centuries, only to come to international attention after aÂ National GeographicÂ expedition in 1911.
This Inca CityÂ wasÂ lost forÂ centuries in the cloud forest,Â until it wasÂ romanticallyÂ âre-discoveredâÂ by explorer Hiram Bingham (with theÂ help of locals who always knew it was there). Straddling a high mountain ridge,Â itÂ was famouslyÂ bult asÂ the Incaâs secretÂ final refugeÂ âÂ butÂ you canât help thinking they chose the locationÂ forÂ the view.
ItÂ was abandoned around the time of the Spanish Conquest, and remains relatively intact because it was never discovered by the Conquistadors.

Hike the Inca Trail
Cusco, Cusco Region, Peru
Bucket List Experience
Plunging valleys dripping with waterfalls,Â snow-capped peaks looming overhead, Inca ruins cresting high mountain ridges surrounded by hummingbird-filled cloud forestÂ âÂ and the mist rising off Machu Picchu itself, warmed by the rising sun;Â the Inca Trail truly is one of the worldâs greatest treks.Â
But itâs no walk in the park. The four-day route follows an ancient Inca road for 43km; rising and falling over passes and valleys and reaching a maximum elevation atÂ the ominously-named Dead Womanâs Pass at 4200 metres. Itâs breathy, muscle-aching work, but the views of lost Inca ruins and spectacular scenery make it an unforgettable experience.Â
The standard trek takes four days; however, some operators offer the option of five days on the trail. This allows for a more leisurely pace and time to linger and explore some of the Inca ruins along the way.
Adult price: Â£Â£377

Cruise the River Amazon
Iquitos, Loreto Region, Peru
Bucket List Experience
Travel deep into the humid rainforest on a small expedition boat to explore the headwaters of the Peruvian Amazon, one of the most inaccessible areas on the planet.
Most expeditions start in Iquitos and take you to the wildlife-rich Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve, sailing along broad, muddy rivers, the bottle-green forest stretching in every direction, scarlet macaws flying overhead and occasionally, pink river dolphins swimming alongside the ship.
Expert guides lead forays ashore in search of three-toed sloths, howler and capuchin monkeys, while flat-bottomed skiffs take you along the skinny, snaking waterways of this flooded landscape to look for caiman, turtles and piranhas.
There are frequent encounters with indigenous tribes, offering a fascinating cultural insight. Kayaking, piranha fishing and swimming in freshwater river pools are all on offer.
An intrepid spirit is essential for these adventurous expeditions, which tend to attract a well-travelled crowd.

Hike the Santa Cruz Circuit
Huaraz, Ancash Region, Peru
Bucket List Experience
The Santa Cruz Circuit is the gold standard of short Andes hikes, and one of the most beautiful walks in South America. The landscapes are magnificent and the 50km trail â which takes three or four days â is doable for the moderately fit.
You wonât see long ridges of 5,000m-high, snow-capped peaks hiking on the Inca Trail around Cusco. But you will on the Santa Cruz hike, which cuts through the heart of the Cordillera Blanca â the highest range of mountains in the tropics. The trail runs through plunging valleys dotted with clear-water lakes, climbs over breathy passes, and passes by the giant 6,768m peak of Huascaran â the tallest mountain in Peru.
The Santa Cruz trek is the short counterpart to the even more spectacular, but longer and more challenging, Huayhuash circuit. Opt for Santa Cruz if youâve only one week to spare and have concerns about altitude sickness.

Limaâs best food & drink
Lima, Lima Region, Peru
Bucket List Experience
If thereâs one reason to stopÂ over in Lima itâs the food. The city has some of theÂ finestÂ restaurants in the world – with chefs like Virgilio MartÃ­nez, JaimeÂ PesaqueÂ andÂ GastÃ³nÂ AcurioÂ ranked in theÂ Worldâs âFifty Bestâ on the exclusive San Pellegrino list.
What makes Lima chefs so exciting is their virtuosoÂ fusionÂ of uniqueÂ national ingredients withÂ Asian and EuropeanÂ techniques.Â Star chef Pedro MiguelÂ SchiaffinoÂ has aÂ plateÂ on his degustation comprising only potatoesÂ arranged to look like beach pebblesÂ â allÂ from different Andean locationsÂ withÂ astonishing, divergent flavours.
Peruvian-Japanese Micha Tsumura servesÂ fieryÂ tiger milkÂ tunaÂ tiraditos alongsideÂ river-fishÂ sushi,Â and 50-hour-cooked Amazonian beef.
You could spend a week in the gastro-hub suburbs ofÂ San Isidro,Â Miraflores andÂ BarrancoÂ and get a mere taste of the exciting scene. But be sureÂ to dine inÂ Astrid y Gaston â the pioneer of Lima gastronomy and Central,Â by Michelin-starred Virgilio MartÃ­nez.
For a sense of the huge variety of ingredients Limaâs top chefs draw on visit Mercado No1 deÂ SurquilloÂ â packed with exotic fruit, vegetables and medicinal plants. Itâs also a good spot to sample simple ceviche, but donât focus on the street food â Limaâs all about fine dining.
Adult price: Â£35

Hike the Huayhuash Circuit
Huaraz, Ancash Region, Peru
Bucket List Experience
Hikers in the know call this the greatest alpine trek in the world. Mountain scenery just doesnât get better â steep valleys of jagged snow-capped peaks reaching heights of over 6,000m, dotted with icy blue lakes; fiery razor-sharp ridges caught in the setting sun, high glaciers, condors flying over fields of grazing vicunasâ¦
On the way you pass some of the most spectacular peaks in the Andes including SiulÃ¡ Grande, site of Joe Simpsonâs epic ‘Touching the Void’; and 6634 metre-high YerupajÃ¡, the second-tallest mountain in the tropics.
Be aware that Huayhuash is a long, tiring high-altitude walk that makes the Inca Trail look like a stroll. Most hikers do the circuit itself in around 11-12 days. Youâll need at least two weeks including essential acclimatisation.
Adult price: Â£1000

Duration: 12 days

A day in Cusco
Cusco, Cusco Region, Peru
Bucket List Experience
Cusco was the Inca capital, laid out in the shape of a giant puma, sitting at the heart of an empire that stretched to Ecuador and Bolivia.Â It was from Cuzco that the Incas administered their vast empire and the city centreâs tight grid, laid out in the 1400s, still bears their mark â as well as that of their conquerors, the Spanish.
Inca foundations are capped with Mediterranean-style structures, and the sun temple has an adjacent baroque church.Â Inca ruins litter the cityÂ â the bell-shapedÂ QoricanchaÂ temple, hulkingÂ SacsayhuamanÂ fort with its massive ramparts and Inca walls everywhere â jigsaw-pieced together from huge boulders, cut into bewildering geometric shapes.Â There are Spanish treasures too â magnificent churches and convents decoratedÂ with art made by indigenousÂ PeruvianÂ artisans.
Today, Cusco is the official âhistoric capitalâ of Peru and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.Â Yet many visitors use Cusco merely as a base for Machu Picchu, and miss out on all these sights.

Colca Canyon
Arequipa Region, Peru
Bucket List Experience
Two kilometres deep, surrounded by steaming volcanoes, and with condors soaring on the thermals, Colca Canyon is one of Peruâs great natural wonders. Itâs twice the depth of the Grand Canyon, far wilder and has wonderful views at every turn.
Day-trippers come to peer over the rim and spot condors. Trekkers hike the rugged trails, stopping to soak in the hot springs or swim in the icy Colca River, which ribbons the canyon floor. And farmers still till the soil on the ancient valley terraces cut long before the Spanish arrived.
Good for age: 13+

Hiram Bingham Train
Cusco, Cusco Region, Peru
Bucket List Experience
If you’re not hiking the Inca Trail, this isÂ the way to reach the famous Inca ruins of Machu Picchu in comfort and style. Starting from the former Inca capital at Cusco, youâre whisked through the Sacred Valley of the Incas, past the towering Inca fortresses of Pisac and Ollantaytambo before entering the rainforest-shrouded Urubamba Valley.
Named after the man who rediscovered the ruins of Machu Picchu in 1911, this specially built narrow-gauge train has opulent carriages redolent of 1920s Pullman cars, with comfortable armchairs surrounded by varnished wood and brass fittings. Food is served in the dining car on fine white linen; dishes feature local ingredients in unfamiliar ways (with abundant Pisco Sours). A band plays Peruvian music with the cajÃ³n and tambourines in the bar car.
There are wonderful views en route â misty mountains, forgotten Quechua villages, distant ridges of serrated snow-capped peaks. The open observation car at the back of the train is the perfect place to soak in the views.
Transfers, guides and tea at the exclusive Sanctuary Lodge are included in the price.
Adult price: Â£550

Duration: 3 hours

A day in Lima
Lima Region, Peru
Bucket List Experience
Founded in 1535 by Francisco Pizarro â audacious conqueror of the Inca Empire â Lima was the capital of most of Spanish South America for nearly 300 years. The affairs of an empire were once managed from its narrow, low-slung streets, but today the cityâs colonial heart is choked with traffic and soot. Â
However, to understand Peruvian history, this 500-year-old grid is a must-see, housing extravagant baroque churches, historic buildings, the presidential palace and the cathedral where Pizarro is buried. Look out for the San Francisco church with its bone-filled catacombs, the filigree-carved balconies of Torre Tagle mansion and the opulent, rococo archbishopâs palace.
Elsewhere, there are fascinating museums dedicated to Peruâs history. The best museums sit in the colonial centre. They include MALI, a Lima Art gallery, with 7,000 pre-Columbian and Spanish pieces, all housed in a beautiful art nouveau building set in gardens. The Gold Museum has glittering artefacts from the countryâs principal ancient civilisations.
The city also has a renowned world-class dining scene and some of the finest restaurants in the world, serving up a virtuoso fusion of unique national ingredients with Asian and European techniques. Book ahead for the best restaurants.
Most trips to Peru inevitably involve a stop in Lima â thankfully there’s plenty worth seeing for a day.

Nazca Lines
Nazca, Ica Region, Peru
Bucket List Experience
A broad alluvial plain in the southern desert contains one of Peruâs most enigmatic sights: dozens of 2,000-year-old glyphs carved into the earth, on a scale so gargantuan that they can only be seen from the air. These land drawings of a monkey, spider and other figures have drawn legions of archaeologists, conspiracy theorists and curious travellers since they were first discovered in the 1920s.
The designs were made by removing reddish stones from the desert terrain to reveal the grey ground beneath. The windless, near-lifeless landscape preserved the glyphs over the centuries.
TheyÂ were probably created over more than a millennium by three different groups: theÂ Paracas, the Nazca and the Huari; but no one knows why.Â Explanations vary;Â they may have beenÂ usedÂ asÂ aÂ giant astronomical calendar,Â aÂ ritualised walking meditation orÂ to communicate with the gods.
Adult price: Â£65
Good for age: 13+

Sacred Valley
Cusco Region, Peru
Bucket List Experience
Towering snow-capped mountains, myriad Inca ruins, time-forgotten villages â the landscapes of the Sacred Valley of the Incas, which lies some 15km north of Cusco, are magnificent. Spending time here is a must.
The best way to appreciate this beautiful place is by getting active. Hike to the Inca ruins at Pisac for astonishing views; white-water raft on the Urubamba past the vast fortress at Ollantaytambo, horseback ride, mountain bike or zip-line over the valley; stay in a hotel room stapled to the side of a vertiginous cliff.
Thereâs a wealth of excursions â easily organised from Cusco as a day trip or multi-day stay.
Good for age: 13+

Lake Titicaca
Puno Region, Peru
Bucket List Experience
Straddling the borders of Peru and Bolivia, Lake Titicaca is South America’s largest lake by water volume. According to Andean lore, the lake was venerated as the birthplace of the Sun God; located at a staggering 3,830m above sea level, itâs not hard to see why it would inspire such beliefs â and the sunsets are glorious.
The lake is also the cradle of the Incas and the ancient Tiwanaku Empire: archaeological sites litter its shores.
Adult price: Â£3

Andean Explorer
Arequipa Region, Peru
Bucket List Experience
Belmond has become a byword for luxury train travel, and South Americaâs first luxury sleeping-car train has become the way to explore the austere beauty of the altiplano south of Cusco.
The two-night tour between Cusco and Arequipa takes in the journey takes in the floating reed islands of Lake Titicaca, cave art thousands of years old, and the World Heritage Site of Arequipa. Wild grasses cover the hillsides rising up to snowy summits until the train descends to more fertile country dotted with adobe villages.
As a new train, itâs beautifully designed and has every amenity, but it inevitably lacks that sense of authenticity from times gone by.
Adult price: Â£3000

Duration: 2 nights

Qorikancha
Cusco, Cusco Region, Peru
Bucket List Experience
Dedicated to the sun and the moon, and with twin rooms once covered in solid gold and silver, the Qorikancha temple was the spiritual heart of the Inca Empire.
The building was literally laid out as a giant âSun, star and moon dialâ, used to physically track the movements of a diversity of astronomical bodies and to coordinate these with day-to-day planning and crop-planting across the Empire.
This was once the richest, most elaborate temple to Inti â the sun â in the entire Inca empire. âQorikanchaâ means âgolden courtyardâ. Unfortunately, the golden walls â and other gold-sculpted treasures â were looted and melted down by the Conquistadors on their arrival in the city.
Only the magnificent stoneworkÂ remains; a curved,Â perfectly-fitted wall, inside which are the remains ofÂ the last IncaÂ emperor:Â TupacÂ Amaru.
Adult price: Â£2
Good for age: 18+

Sacsayhuaman
Cusco, Cusco Region, Peru
Bucket List Experience
This ruined Inca fortressÂ and ceremonial centreÂ to the sunÂ perchesÂ over Cusco â with magnificent views of the cityÂ from its massive walls. The masonry boggles the mind: boulders weighing hundreds of tons cut into strangeÂ geometricÂ shapesÂ âÂ transported without theÂ use of theÂ wheelÂ âÂ areÂ jigsaw-pieced togetherÂ without cementÂ or metal tools.
The ruins represent just a fifth of its original mass. Even so, itâs an imposing sight: a series of tri-level ramparts hundreds of metres long and overlooking a vast field. The scale of some boulders is truly monumental, a testament to the ingenuity of Inca masonry.
Adult price: Â£24
Good for age: 18+

Ollantaytambo
Cusco Region, Peru
Bucket List Experience
Of all the Inca sights in Peru, only Machu Picchu is more impressive than this huge fortress. Itâs cut into the mountain above the Sacred Valley, with massive cut stones and vast terraces.
Machu Picchu was never discovered by the Spanish â instead, it fell through neglect. By contrast,Â OllantaytamboÂ was the last stronghold of the Incas near Cusco and the site of a famous victory. In 1536, Manco Inca diverted the course of the RiverÂ PatacanchaÂ to wash away the advancing Spanish and their Amazonian Indian allies.
It was another thirty years before the Incas finally fell and the ruins â with crumbling walls and astonishing views â have an even greaterÂ poignancy than Machu Picchu.
Good for age: 13+

Inca ruins at Pisac (and Pisac market)
Pisac, Cusco Region, Peru
Bucket List Experience
These beautifully preserved Inca ruins straddle a high mountain ridge affording wonderful views over the Andes and the Sacred Valley.
The intricate Inca stonework â pieced together without cutting implements or mortar â is some of the best youâll see. Pisac is one of the few places with an intact Inca Intihuatana altar â used for plotting the movement of the stars and for the veneration of the sun.
Pisac’s ruins can be reached easily by cab from Cusco, or you can opt for a breathy, spectacular day hike up the mountain from Pisac village below.
Adult price: Â£40
Good for age: 18+

Hike the Choquequirao Inca Trail
Cusco Region, Peru
Experience
IfÂ Machu PicchuÂ in the most spectacular of the Inca ruins, lost for centuries among the Andes,Â ChoquequiraoÂ comes a closeÂ second. Surrounded by lush forests andÂ jagged, icyÂ peaksÂ and perched on the side of a precipitous gorge, itâs breathtakingly situated â butÂ while some 3,000 tourists a day come to Machu Picchu, Choquequirao receives just aÂ few.
There are two ways in â on a fiveÂ or nine-day mountain hikeÂ (with twoÂ nightsÂ camping at the site). If youâre fit andÂ have time,Â opt for the longerÂ walk, which followsÂ an Inca road. The landscapes are spectacular:Â cutting through steamy cloud forests,Â overÂ condor-soared mountain passes,Â overnighting inÂ indigenous villages, visitingÂ myriadÂ ancientÂ ruins including ChoquequiraoÂ itself.
The walk finishesÂ with a dramatic descentÂ and climbÂ throughÂ one ofÂ the worldâsÂ deepestÂ riverÂ valleys, though you can also continue on to Machu Picchu.
While Choquequirao receives only 1% of Machu Picchuâs visitors,Â there will still be a few tour groups.

Paracas National Reserve
Paracas, Ica Region, Peru
Bucket List Experience
The coast around the little resort town of Paracas, including this 335,000-hectare reserve, is some of the most impressive in tropical South America: dune-rolling desert runs to caramel and blood-red crags that crumble over sheer cliffs. Powerful Pacific waves pound endless empty beaches of honey-yellow and coral-red sands.
Much of the region is protected: for its natural beauty, for the hundreds of barely-explored archaeological sites and for the abundant sea life. Sealions and Humboldt penguins bask on the sand. Just offshore, hundreds of thousands of Guanay Cormorants, boobies, terns and fur seals live on the Ballestas archipelago – a string of islands are scattered like desert rocks thrown into the blue of the Pacific.
Good for age: 13+

Huacachina Oasis [sandboarding]
Huacachina, Ica Region, Peru
Bucket List Experience
Huddled under palm trees around a little lake set in a sand-sea of rippling dunes, Huacachina village looks like a film set for Dune.
Beauty alone makes it worth a special visit, but thereâs plenty to do â from desert hiking and buggy rides to sandboard-surfing the wave-like dunes â which are the tallest in South America. There are plenty of operators in town offering classes and boards to rent, but choose carefully, the sport can be as dangerous for novices as snowboarding.
Over the last decade, Huacachina has become a backpacker hangout â with bars along the lakeshore pumping out music and serving cheap cocktails, and hostels lining the streets behind. But while accommodation in the village is backpacker-simple, Ica city, a ten-minute drive away has comfortable rooms and is connected with Lima by plane and bus.

Santa Catalina Monastery
Arequipa, Arequipa Region, Peru
Bucket List Experience
Peruâs most impressive colonial building? Itâs hard to beat this 16th-century, 20,000sq m convent founded in 1580.
Like a secretÂ worldÂ âÂ secured behind high walls and still perfectly-preservedÂ âÂ Santa Catalina was a complete village hidden in urban Arequipa; a Moorish hamlet of narrow alleys, avenues of arches lined with terracottaÂ paint and whitewash,Â and secret, fountain-tingling orange-blossom-scented atrium-gardens.
The convent has innumerable works by Cusco School artists, a colonial movement fusing European and indigenous traditions. The painting of Saint Jerome in the convent museum, the Sala Zurbaran, is a treasured example.
Alongside the art, itâs asÂ atmospheric as a Spaghetti Western and sits under a smoking volcano and a permanently blue sky.Â It alsoÂ provides an intriguing insight into the life of the Arequipa elite during the colonial heyday.
Adult price: Â£8

Lima Art Museum
Lima, Lima Region, Peru
Experience
If you want to see ancient Peruvian art and artifacts then MALI and LARCO are Limaâs two must-see museums. While LARCO is a 15-minute cab ride from anywhere, MALI is easy to visit on a walk around the colonial centre. Â
Thereâs a lot to see â with more than 7,000 pieces dating from theÂ time of theÂ ParacasÂ desert peopleÂ inÂ 800BC (ancestors of the Nazca civilisation) to the present day. Thereâs some fabulous indigenous-painted Cusco art and the collection is housed in aÂ lavishÂ art-nouveau-meets-neoclassical palace sitting in shady, lawned gardens.
Adult price: Â£2
Good for age: 18+

Larco Museum
Lima, Lima Region, Peru
Experience
Lima has two unmissable museums, the Museum of Art and the Larco; the Larco preserves one of the best collections of pre-Columbian and indigenous objects in Peru.
There are pieces from over 3,000 years of Peruvian history â from brilliantly-painted Moche ceramics to glittering Inca gold and intricately, hand-stitched textiles. This is the only museum anywhere to have an entire room of pre-Columbian erotica. These priceless pieces are kept in the vast, gleaming-white, fortified palace of the colonial viceroy; itself built over an ancient pyramid.

Protecting aÂ huge swatheÂ of the Peruvian Amazon, this landscape of meandering waterwaysÂ âÂ cutting through cloud-forest-coveredÂ mountains and spreading over a vast area ofÂ lowlandÂ jungleÂ has one of the greatest biodiversity levels on Earth.
There areÂ eight different life zones with more than 150 species of tree, 100 species of mammal and 1,300 species of butterfly. Many endangered animals hunted toÂ the brink ofÂ extinction elsewhere in the Amazon are still found here, including jaguar,Â BrazilianÂ tapir,Â giant river otter andÂ theÂ HarpyÂ EagleÂ âÂ theÂ largest eagle in theÂ world.

Festival of the Sun
Cusco, Cusco Region, Peru
Bucket List Experience
Travellers from all over Peru and the world descend onÂ CuscoÂ every 24 June for the Festival of the Sun,Â which marks the Winter Solstice. Still known by its Inca nameÂ IntiÂ Raymi, it has been celebrated in some form forÂ centuries.
The festival begins the night before with processions and makeshift stalls in the Plaza de Armas. Dancing parades move off from the Qorikancha temple at 10am, processing to the fort at Sacsayhuaman, where there is a full-scale re-enactment of an ancient Inca sun ceremony.
If you want to avoid the crowds, settle into one of the second-floor restaurants around the main square. Late in the afternoon the procession will come to you.
One of the most interesting parts ofÂ IntiÂ RaymiÂ is the impromptu dance party that takes place in Cuscoâs main squareÂ afterÂ the official party is over â definitely worth staying for.

Lima Cathedral
Lima, Lima Region, Peru
Experience
With massive, imposingÂ neoclassicalÂ bellÂ towers framing a saint-encrusted baroque facade topped with the Virgin Mary,Â the capitalâs first church, built in the early 16th century,Â is a joyless statement of religious authority in stone.
Itâs appropriate then, that the battered corpse of Francisco Pizarro is entombed inside, in a modest chapel in the crypt. Francisco Pizarro was the Spanish conquistador who conquered the Inca Empire, capturing its capital city Cuzco in 1533 and founding the city of Lima in 1535. Most people come to see him.
The nave is unremarkable âÂ its baroque artÂ wasÂ destroyed in an 18th-century earthquake.Â But look out for the silver-covered altars and Pizarroâs coat of arms (next to those of Lima) in passing.

Delhi, Jaipur and Agra â the so-called ‘Golden Triangle’ â lie at the heart of many Indian cultural tours and form the backbone of most first-time visits to India. These three destinations pack in most of India’s most bucket list experiences and all of its unique cultural essence.
Delhi, the capital, presents two distinct faces: Raj-era New Delhi boasts neat tree-lined boulevards and most of the best hotels, while Old Delhi distils a frantic, earthier atmosphere and is dotted with medieval monuments.
Agra is synonymous with the iconic Taj Mahal while Jaipur is the vibrant capital of Rajasthan, an exotic desert state hosting massive forts and exquisite palaces. A few hours from Jaipur is the Ranthambore National Park, one of the best places in India to see wild tigers.
There are good transport links between the three destinations, but for a real treat, take the luxury Mahajaras Express train which shuttles you between the main stops in blissful comfort, as you stare out at India’s uniquely exotic and evocative scenery.

Taj Mahal
Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India
Bucket List Experience
One of the worldâs most beautiful buildings is not merely an exquisite tomb but a monument to love. The Taj Mahal was completed after two decadesâ labour in 1653 by the great Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan to entomb his wife, Mumtaz.
It stands at the head of formal gardens by the Yamuna River. The combination of milky-white marble (much of it inlaid with semi-precious stones, a technique known as pietra dura), a great bulbous dome and four slender minarets lend the mausoleum an astonishing almost ethereal beauty.
Admire it at your leisure â its well-kept gardens coax lingering, relaxed visits.

Tiger safari in Ranthambore National Park
Ranthambore National Park, Rajasthan, India
Bucket List Experience
Few other animals have quite captured the imagination as the Bengal tiger. Indiaâs national animal since 1973, itâs one of two subspecies that once roamed widely from eastern Russia and Turkey to Indo-China. Indiaâs 3,000-odd tigers are scattered among around 50 reserves and, for visitors, Ranthambore in Rajasthan is among the most famous and popular.
Formerly a royal hunting ground, Ranthamboreâs pretty forests and appealingly rugged hillsides also boast water bodies and a picturesque 13th-century fortress. Game drives are particularly enjoyable and sightings are reliably good â but not guaranteed.

Amber Fort
Jaipur, Rajasthan, India
Bucket List Experience
Pre-Independence Rajasthan, or âLand of the Princesâ, comprised an intricate patchwork of princely states. Numerous maharajasâ palaces and forts still dot the landscape and among the most famous is 16th-century Amber (also known as Amer), a huge fortress-palace cresting a stark ridge above Amer village near Jaipur.
Enclosed by kilometres of walls snaking across the surrounding hills, at its heart the huge complex comprises audience halls, pavilions, royal âapartmentsâ and courtyards that collectively blend Hindu and Mughal motifs and architecture. Part-marble interiors boast decorative paintings, mirrored-glass mosaics and coloured glass. Itâs a great place to wander and explore.

Red Fort
Delhi, India
Bucket List Experience
Delhiâs largest historic monument was built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in the 1640s, and the massive sandstone walls still bristle with crenellations between the elegant cupolas. Within lies a 250-acre complex of gardens, audience halls, pavilions, royal apartments and a small white-marble mosque.
Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the fort personifies the scale and power of the dynastic Mughals whose three-century reign profoundly influenced the history and culture of North India.

Indiaâs Mughal Empire
India
Bucket List Experience
Founded in the 1520s by Babur, a warrior chieftain from present-day Uzbekistan and a descendant of Timur (or Tamerlane), the Mughal Empire quickly dominated most of north, central and even a swathe of south India for two centuries, before limping into terminal decline for a third.
At its height, the Mughals effectively ruled most of India, from present-day Pakistan all the way east to Assam, and from Kashmir in the north to parts of Tamil Nadu in the south.
Its military prowess, efficient administration and generally outward-looking embrace of existing elites and cultures helped generate prosperity, while its emperors patronised painting, literature and textiles.
But itâs their grand architecture, including some of Indiaâs most iconic monuments such as the Taj Mahal, that have proved their most enduring and tangible legacy.
Its capital shifted between Delhi, Agra, Fatehpur Sikri and Lahore (Pakistan), and it is these destinations which today boast virtually all of the Mughalsâ finest monuments.

City Palace
Jaipur, Rajasthan, India
Bucket List Experience
When Maharaja Jai Singh II shifted his capital from Amber in around 1727, he laid the foundations for a meticulously planned city â Jaipur. City Palace lies at the heart of the Old City, a stirring complex of palaces, halls, courtyards and pavilions embodying the power and stature of one of Rajasthanâs leading royal families.
The glitz and glamour are tempered by various displays, from a quirky collection of carriages and palanquins to an astonishing armoury.

Agra Fort
Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India
Bucket List Experience
Completed by the Mughal emperor Akbar in 1573 on the site of a ruined fortification, Agra Fort bears a striking resemblance to Delhi’s Red Fort.
Massive, rust-red sandstone walls of around two and a half kilometres enclose 94 acres, its eastern flank overlooking a bend in the Yamuna River and within sight of the Taj Mahal.
It’s the south-eastern section, behind the Amar Singh gate entrance, that holds the most interest: gardens, open-sided audience halls, pavilions and royal apartments plus a couple of dainty mosques.
Infamously imprisoned by his own son, it was from here that emperor Shah Jahan spent his final days gazing across at his beloved Taj.

Palace of the Winds
Jaipur, Rajasthan, India
Bucket List Experience
The intricate lattice-screened and salmon-pink facade of the Hawa Mahal, or the ‘Palace of Winds’, is probably the most iconic image of Jaipur, Rajasthan’s capital.
Constructed in 1799 as an extension of the maharaja’s City Palace, it was designed to permit ladies of the royal court to see the comings and goings of the outside world without themselves being seen by strangers. This tradition of purdah â essentially female seclusion â was strictly observed by the royals.
Its hundreds of tiny arched windows and niches with decorative dome-like mouldings and balcony-like brackets are rather fetching. The entire mahal is reputedly shaped like the god Krishna’s crown. Surprisingly, there’s not much to see behind the facade.

Raj history in Delhi
Delhi, India
Bucket List Experience
The âRajâ refers to Britain’s formal rule over India from 1859 until independence in 1947. Yet Britainâs involvement dates back to the East India Companyâs (EIC) first toehold in the subcontinent in 1608, when its ships docked in Surat (in Gujarat state), followed by more trading posts in Chennai and Kolkata.
Gradually eclipsing their Portuguese and Dutch rivals, King Charles II granted the EIC powers to acquire territory, form armies and essentially become a colonial government.
By the 1770s the EIC had financial troubles, and its controversial bailout by the British government converged with a realisation that its power and influence was underpinned by corruption, cronyism, plunder and greed. Things came to a head with the so-called Indian Mutiny of 1857, when its own Indian soldiers rebelled.
In the wake of this disastrous episode, the British government stepped in, bringing much of the EICâs holdings under Crown control. In 1877 Queen Victoria was proclaimed Empress of India; the legacy of her rule endures Indiaâs legal and administrative systems.
Rather more tangible for visitors is its public, often grand, architecture. New Delhi was a Raj creation, many cities still have âcantonmentsâ (or garrison neighbourhoods) and the Himalayan foothills are dotted with âhill stationsâ where the Brits could escape the worst of the pre-monsoon heat.

Fatehpur Sikri
Fatehpur, Uttar Pradesh, India
Bucket List Experience
In the late 1500s, the Mughal Emperor Akbar constructed a new capital near Agra â Fatehpur Sikri.
The Mughalsâ first planned city was monumental in scale and design, and notable for the mastery and finesse of its predominantly red sandstone architecture. The cityâs rather abrupt abandonment after fifteen years remains a mystery, though a lack of water is usually cited as the cause.
Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the atmospheric âghost cityâ provides a fascinating and unique insight into the Mughal court. Huge colonnaded courtyards, lofty audience halls, a treasury and royal apartments skilfully blend Muslim and Hindu traditions â in keeping with Akbarâs enlightened perspective.
Good for age: 13+

Delhiâs food & drink
Delhi, India
Bucket List Experience
Thanks largely to its luxury hotels, Delhi’s food scene is as varied and cosmopolitan as you’ll find anywhere in India.
North Indian cuisine â Punjabi in particular â is ubiquitous in Delhi. Typically dominated by rich meat and vegetable dishes using clarified butter, or ghee, as a base for their sauces, they’re accompanied by a range of leavened and unleavened breads such as chapatis, rotis and naan. A healthier option is meat cooked in a clay oven, or tandoor, with its distinctive spices and flavour.
Carnivores might also embrace ‘frontier (as in the Northwest Frontier of present-day Pakistan) cuisine’ with its simple rustic style and predominance of tandoor-cooked kebabs.
Chaat, or savoury snacks, are served from an array of hand carts, stalls and eateries across the city. This ever-popular tasty âstreet foodâ typically encompasses combinations of potatoes, dal, chickpeas and fried dough garnished with onions, spices, curd and sauces. Perhaps the only downside is that delicate stomachs might struggle with the hygiene.

Akshardham Temple
Delhi, India
Bucket List Experience
Five years in the making with a vast workforce, the huge Akshardham Temple complex was completed in 2005 by the Swaminarayan sect of Hinduism. Drawing on the venerable traditions of temple architecture, colossal amounts of carving were augmented by spacious parkland and gardens.
Yet itâs more than just a temple â a musical fountain, animatronic displays and a âHall of Valuesâ aims to distil the wisdom and spirituality of India in a kind of cultural campus, all infused with Swaminarayanâs philosophy.
It was built according to ancient Hindu texts, which describe specific methods for constructing Hindu temples. 7,000 artisan sculptors and thousands of volunteers helped build the vast building, adorned with thousands of intricate carvings including sages, rishis, devotees and playful elephants.

Johari Bazaar
Jaipur, Rajasthan, India
Bucket List Experience
When Maharaja Jai Singh founded his new capital in the 1720s, its grid plan helped make it a commercial centre, too, with particular trades congregating in their own little enclaves.
In downtown Jaipur, stretching from Sanganeri Gate towards the Palace of the Winds, Johari is its principal gem and jewellery centre. For all its multifarious arts and crafts, the city is renowned above all for its jewellery industry and the arcaded shop-fronts that line the busy main thoroughfare are largely given over to it.
Filled with hole-in-the-wall workshops and industrious craftsmen perched on their haunches with braziers, burrs and sanding files, its side streets and lanes are even more interesting.
Good for age: 13+

Abhaneri Step Well
Abhaneri, Rajasthan, India
Bucket List Experience
Constructed by King Chanda in the 8th or 9th century, this baori, or ‘step well’, is a superb example of medieval engineering designed to ‘harvest’ water.
With around 3,500 steps, and thirteen ‘floors’ with decoratively carved balconies, the well’s geometry is both beautiful and functional â users could access water easily as levels fell with the approach of summer and even seek relief from the sun and heat.
Once fairly common across Rajasthan and Gujarat (though rarely as elaborate), many ancient step wells have fallen into disrepair â if not obscurity â and few remain in use today.
Though unused, Abhaneri (also known as Chand Baori) remains in particularly good condition and is one of the best examples of a step well in the whole of India; a bewitching combination of awe-inspiring architecture and medieval ingenuity.
Good for age: 8+

Friday Mosque
Delhi, India
Bucket List Experience
Completed in 1656 and still among Indiaâs largest and most beautiful mosques, the Friday Mosque, or Jama Masjid, was yet another of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahanâs great projects (which climaxed in the Taj Mahal).
With a huge courtyard, a great bulbous dome and a pair of slender striped minarets, its graceful form is enhanced by the decorative interplay of sandstone and marble. Pivotal to the character and atmosphere of Old Delhi, itâs often full to capacity â around 25,000 â during Friday morning prayers.
For a small fee you can climb one of the minarets. Although the narrow stairwell is claustrophobic, there are stunning views over the courtyard across Old Delhi to the Red Fort.

National Museum of India

Casting the curatorial net to embrace not just modern India but the wider subcontinent and parts of its immediate hinterland, this excellent museum provides a fine overview of several millennia of the regionâs arts and history.
While its main strength is an array of sculpture depicting the vast pantheon of Hindu gods and goddesses, exhibits encompass Silk Road artefacts, various schools of miniature painting, tribal arts and crafts, weaponry, textiles and jewellery.
The museum also houses the Sacred Relics of Buddha (5th-4th century BC), unearthed in Uttar Pradesh, and an exceptional collection of rare musical instruments from the 15th to 19th centuries.

Raj Mandir Cinema
Jaipur, Rajasthan, India
Bucket List Experience
Commonly referred to as âBollywoodâ and mainly centred on Mumbai, the Indian film industry is huge and probably the worldâs largest. Its staple themes of romance and melodrama are famed above all for their elaborate, frequently surreal, song-and-dance sequences. In this ever-popular genre, reality and pure escapism live side by side, one blending into the other. Seeing a Bollywood movie is thus an authentically âIndianâ experience.
If you only venture into one Indian cinema, this should be it. Opened in 1976, it immediately became a landmark for its size and design â a flamboyant confection of late art deco style with lobby chandeliers, ornamental ceilings and floral scent piped through the air-conditioning. Seating is divided into Pearl, Ruby, Emerald and Diamond zones reflecting its ownersâ gem dealing business which helped fund its construction.
Although movies are not in English, Bollywood stories are usually very easy to follow, and simply sitting among an all-Indian audience, who tend to clap, cheer and sing their way through movies, is an experience in itself.

Kinari Bazaar
Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India
Bucket List Experience
A little west of Agra Fort and seemingly loomed over by the striking minarets of the Friday Mosque (Jami Masjid), Kinariâs tangle of streets and lanes hosts one of the cityâs most enjoyable markets.
Thereâs likely been a bazaar here since Mughal times and its staple products are no longer merely fabrics and embroidery. These days you can find all manner of brass-ware, jewellery, marquetry and marble along with cosmetics, perfume and decorative knick-knacks. Itâs popular with locals and tourists, although â fabric aside â probably not the place for high-end craftsmanship or âantiquesâ.

Humayunâs Tomb
Delhi, India
Bucket List Experience
Built in the late 1500s as a mausoleum for the Mughal emperor Humayun, this Persian-inspired confection of sandstone and marble laid the foundations for a style that reached its apogee in the Taj Mahal. Set atop an imposing arcaded plinth, itâs a profoundly elegant and atmospheric monument.
Like the Taj Mahal, this tomb is also a ‘monument to love’, built at great expense by Humayunâs second wife nine years after his death.
The surrounding formal gardens, with their shallow water channels and features, are integral to the siteâs appeal and make for one of Delhiâs loveliest and most tranquil havens.

Bucket List Experience
For a thoroughly earthy and immersive experience of Old Delhi, hire a cycle rickshaw to take you there and navigate the backstreets and lanes of one of the cityâs most atmospheric, if not chaotic, areas.
Despite the clamour and congestion, itâs a vibrant friendly place and a fascinating way to reach the Red Fort and/or the Friday Mosque (Jama Masjid).
Rickshaws weave their way through the chaotic traffic, squeezing through the tightest gaps, so keep knees and elbows in at all times. It can be a little nerve-wracking at first, but the drivers are experienced and know what theyâre doing.

Qawwali singing
Delhi, India
Experience
In south Delhi, near Humayunâs Tomb, compact Nizamuddin is an earthy, almost medieval neighbourhood of tight lanes and jumbled houses. At its heart stands the 16th-century tomb-shrine of a 13th-century Sufi saint. Itâs a particularly sacred place for Muslims, especially those drawn to the Sufi tradition, where devotional music and song play a significant role in spiritual life.
Most evenings (Thursdays are the most charged) see groups of qawwals, or bards, and musicians gathered to sing qawwalis (hymns) in the shrineâs courtyard. Itâs a memorable experience; enthusiastic audiences are almost intoxicated by performances and for many outsiders, too, it seems to reinforce the strange power of music to âconnectâ in unexpectedly profound ways.

Elephant Conservation & Care Centre
Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India

Elephants feature prominently in Indian culture and design, from Ganesh, the ubiquitous ‘elephant god’, to architectural & decorative motifs. But for the tiger, it would probably be the national animal.
Yet all is not well with India’s elephant population. Whether used in temples to bestow blessings, for tourist rides (for example at Amber Fort near Jaipur) or for circuses, many end up being exploited and abused.
The ECCC and its hospital look after and rehabilitate captive pachyderms, as well as educating visitors on the importance of elephant conservation.
Located near the Yamuna River and surrounded by farmland, over twenty well-fed elephants are free to roam, enjoy water pools and live as ânaturalâ a life as possible despite their domestication.

Rome
Lazio, Italy
Destination guide
Rome has been on historyâs front page for more than 2,000 years; itâs a city of marvels that has seen glory, greatness and triumph â and excess, murder and decadence â in equal measure. Yet despite its dazzling wealth of ancient, medieval, Renaissance and Baroque art and architecture, the Eternal City is no museum piece.
A thriving and modern metropolis among venerable treasures, Rome boasts a hip, 21st-century art scene, world-class theatre, outstanding shopping, superb cuisine and, of course, gelato. One of Europeâs most exciting capitals, Rome is a shining example of la dolce vita; its many piazzas alive with al fresco bars and restaurants.

The Colosseum

Destination guide
Tourists call it the Big Apple, New Yorkers call it the Capital of the World and that audacity, energy, wealth, power, humour and cosmopolitan pizzazz makes the âcity that never sleepsâ one of the most exciting destinations on Earth. Few places rival its skyline views, culture and dynamism.

A gift from the French to the Americans in 1886 to mark the centenary of American independence, âThe Ladyâ has become New Yorkâs most iconic symbol.

Also on site is the fascinating former immigrant processing office at Ellis Island, now museum, that explains why the city invited mass migrations in the 19th century, how they were settled, and the impacts on life today.

Grand Canyon National Park
Arizona, United States of America (USA)
Destination guide
The 277-mile-long Grand Canyon, with a max width of 18 miles and a maximum depth of (only) over a mile, is not the deepest canyon â both Colca Canyon in Peru and Kali Gandaki Gorge in Nepal are more than twice as deep. But the drama of the landscape and the multi-coloured geology of this extraordinary geological phenomenon is unsurpassed.
The gorge, cut over 2 billion years by the Colorado River, resides within the 1.2-million-acre Grand Canyon National Park â the US’s second most visited park.
Helicopter flights are a thrilling way to see it, but other great ways to experience the canyon are viewing platforms, self-driving routes, white-water rafting on the Colorado River and hiking one of the many superb trails.

White-water rafting through the Grand Canyon
Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona, United States of America (USA)
Bucket List Experience
As white-rafting trips go, few can match the drama and majesty of the soaring Grand Canyon scenery.
The 280-mile stretch of the Colorado River passing through the canyon is home to more than 160 sets of rapids, ranging from Class I to Class 5 (though they have their own rating systems). The Lava Falls, with a 37-feet drop, is the mightiest of all.
The good news is there are a lot of options, from simple, fun day trip adventures covering low-grade rapids to more challenging multi-day camping adventures along the full distance.
For most, a simple one-day trip is enough. These are run from the West Rim by the native Hualapai Indians. Motorised rafts take you a mere 40 miles, the first 12 of which are low-grade rapids. The remaining 28 miles is flatwater where you can sit back and admire the view. The rafting guides tell you stories about the Hualapai and their cultural history as you go.
They also offer a 2-day version, with a night spent campaign in Spencer Canyon and including a hike to a natural waterfall.
The Hualapai’s 1- or 2-day trips are the best if you want the experience, but have limited time or desire for serious rafting, and/or you are coming from Las Vegas.
There are multiple operators offering longer adventures. These trips often include optional daytime hikes â usually no more than 2 miles to take in the scenery and to have a break from the rafting.

Helicopter flights over the Grand Canyon
Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona, United States of America (USA)
Bucket List Experience
There are few more jaw-dropping landscapes in the world than the ‘Grand Canyon’ â the mighty 277-mile long, 1-mile-deep gash, carved into the Arizona rock by the Colorado River.
Given its gargantuan scale, you need height and distance to appreciate its scale and majesty. Helicopter tours afford flyers a bird-eye view, and are able to descend thousands of feet below the canyonâs rim. Some tours even land at the canyonâs base for sunset cocktails.
Without question one of the world’s greatest helicopter flights and unmissable.

Hike the South Kaibab Trail
Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona, United States of America (USA)

Niagara Falls
Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada
Bucket List Experience
You hear the Falls long before you see them: the roaring cascade of water plummeting down a 50m gorge at a rate of millions of litres per second. The worldâs second-largest â but arguably most famous â waterfall is jaw-dropping in its scale and intensity.
The roadside viewpoints offer prime viewing, but there are several other great ways to experience the Falls. Boat trips take you right up to the torrent, and into the foaming spray. Spectacular short helicopter flights offer a unique panoramic view of the scale and surrounding scenery (nervous flyers should head to the top of the nearby Skylon Tower instead).
You can also descend down via old tunnels to extraordinary viewpoints and caves behind the Falls themselves.

Barcelona
Catalonia, Spain
Destination guide
Vibrant, confident, cosmopolitan â few cities in Europe can touch Barcelona for sheer style and exuberance. A progressive cultural and fashion scene is offset with a relaxed Mediterranean atmosphere, long sandy beaches and boat-filled marinas.
There are world-class museums, venerating Spanish artists such as Picasso and Miro, though its perhaps best known for its fluid-looking, ornate âModernistaâ architecture pioneered by the incomparable Gaudi.
Barcelona also takes its food and drink very seriously â with plenty of chic, experimental cuisine served across tapas bars, gastronomic restaurants and hip concept cafes, not to mention a lively all-night bar scene.
This colourful, beautiful metropolis will delight whether youâre 18 or 80.

La Sagrada Familia
Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain
Bucket List Experience
GaudÃ­ spent his last years obsessing over the Sagrada FamÃ­lia, this ornate, turreted cathedral with its iconic turrets like melting candles.
Although only the Birth FaÃ§ade and crypt were completed before he died, and nearly all the plans were lost during the Spanish Civil War, the foundation that owns it has decided to carry on building it according to Gaudiâs surviving drawings.
Funded by ticket admissions, itâs already, even critics admit, the most spectacular church of the 21st century. But itâs quite a labour of love â itâs slated to be finished by 2026.

Barcelonaâs best architecture
Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain
Bucket List Experience
When Barcelona is prosperous, it builds with breathtaking flair. Its superb Gothic buildings are engineering marvels; not for their height, but their width.
During the late 19th century, the city evolved its own Modernista style, related to Art Nouveau but filled with Catalan national symbols (notably dragons).
It also produced one extraordinary genius, Antoni GaudÃ­, whose inspiration went beyond mere decoration to the forms of nature herself. Today Barcelona is reinventing again; just visit the new 22@ District.

Casa Batllo
Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain
Bucket List Experience
There are three Modernista masterpieces in a single block on the Passeig de Gracia, but Gaudiâs Casa Batllo (1906), a shimmering, colour-drenched townhouse designed as an allegory of a dragon, is the most astonishing.
Commissioned by textile industrialist Josep Batllo when Gaudi was at his artistic best, this dazzling widely acclaimed Modernista masterpiece is now a UNESCO-listed World Heritage Site.
The facade is especially beautiful, and though itâs expensive to tour the interior, itâs even more magical inside: brightly tiled, fluid-looking and full of art.
One highlight is the open-air rooftop, where you can admire the bold, surreal chimney stacks and snap photos of the city.

Casa Mila (La Pedrera)
Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain
Bucket List Experience
Officially known as Casa Mila, but immediately dubbed La Pedrera, âthe stone quarryâ by critics, this extraordinary apartment block was Gaudiâs last building before he devoted the rest of his life to the Sagrada Familia.
Itâs hard to imagine a more spectacular swan song, with a faÃ§ade inspired by a sea cliff, complete with fantastical forged iron balconies resembling seaweed. The famous stepped roof features twenty-eight colourful chimneys â known as espanta bruixes (witch-scarers).
It marked the culmination of his experimentation with natural forms, and it’s been called the precursor of Surrealism, Expressionism and Cubism.
One of the original apartments, with no right angles anywhere and where Gaudi designed every single detail down to the doorknobs, is part of the visit.

Park Guell
Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain
Bucket List Experience
In 1902, Eusebi Guell bought two farms set on a natural balcony and commissioned Gaudi to create an exclusive walled housing estate. It flopped, but Park Guell has never failed to enchant as a city park.
Enjoy the fairytale guardianâs houses, mosaic lizard, sinuous stone viaducts, 86-columned Sala Hipostila â the base for an extraordinary, broken tile-clad serpentine bench by Gaudiâs collaborator, Jujol â and sweeping panoramic views across Barcelona.
Gaudi actually bought one of the three houses in the park and lived there from 1906 to 1925, before moving to a hut by the Sagrada Familia. Itâs now a museum.
Although it may seem whimsical, Gaudi and Guell loaded the park with allegories and symbolism, some personal, some Rosicrucian, alchemical and mythological. It is much, much stranger than it looks.

Art in Barcelona
Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain
Bucket List Experience
Great art is in Barcelonaâs blood. Although much was lost in the cityâs turbulent past, the Catalan National Art Museum has the worldâs greatest collection of Romanesque murals, salvaged from remote Pyrenean chapels; both Picasso and Miro, Barcelonaâs 20th-century masters, were inspired by their bold otherworldly figures. The same museum has a treasure trove of elegant, courtly Gothic art from Barcelonaâs golden age, notably by the great Jaume Huguet.
The cityâs second golden age, beginning in the late 19th century, produced Ramon Casas and Santiago Rusinol avant-garde painters headquartered at the Quatre Gats cafe that cultivated the young Picasso.
Other key figures include theorist and abstract expressionist Antoni Tapies, one of the leading figures of 20th-century art in Europe; the famous conceptual artist Angels Ribe; Agusti Puig, heir of Picasso and Miro; and the jovial street artist El Pez.

Monastery of Montserrat
Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain
Bucket List Experience
Montserrat, the âsawn mountainâ, is a jagged massif rising from the plain, 40km outside Barcelona, and famous for being the spot where St Peter allegedly hid a black statue of the Virgin, carved by St Luke, in a cave. The Virgin is now enshrined in a honey-coloured Benedictine monastery, set against undulating rock said to have inspired Gaudi â the setting, now a national park, is so extraordinary that itâs a famous honeymoon spot for Spaniards.
Funiculars ascend to the Santa Cova trail, Sant Joan trail, and (most spectacular) Sant Jeroni trail at the summit. Or join the pilgrims in hiking up â it takes three hours if youâre fit, four if not.

La Rambla
Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain
Experience
Garcia Llorca called it the âmost beautiful street in the worldâ and itâs hard to argue: curving sinuously for a mile down to the sea. It threads past the flower and bird market, news kiosks and cafÃ©s, endless âliving statuesâ and street performers, and some of the cityâs most important monuments: the Baroque Palau de la Virreina, the Liceu Opera and La Boqueria market.
It is, however, a tourist trap, always crowded and bustling and plagued by pick pockets. It can be a bit overwhelming, but itâs worth a quick walk down on your way to the waterfront, market, or another of the landmarks nearby., to say you’ve done it.

Picasso Museum Barcelona
Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain
Bucket List Experience
Barcelona holds significance in Picasso’s life as it was where he spent his formative years and received his artistic education. Although he never returned to Spain after the Civil War, he wanted Barcelona to have works he had created there as a young man.
In 1963, this museum opened in a restored Gothic palace on Barcelonaâs medieval millionairesâ row, which had degenerated into a slum, leading the way for a revival of the now hyper-trendy Born District. Donations over the decades have added to the collection, including Picassoâs 58 paintings inspired by Velazquezâs Las Meninas.
Today, it showcases an extensive collection of Picasso’s early works, including paintings, sculptures, ceramics, and sketches. It’s an absorbing insight into Picasso’s artistic evolution and creative development, and the influences that shaped his groundbreaking style.

Though busy with tourists, itâs a real local institution â the buzz is especially vibrant early in the morning and at lunchtime, when locals gather at the counters to eat tapas and street food, available to take away or eat at the counter, perched on (limited) stools.
The stalls in front take advantage of the passing tourist trade from Las Rambla: head into the interior to take in the truly mind-boggling array of goods (and lower prices).

Okavango Delta
Okavango Delta, Botswana
Destination guide
The Okavango is the largest inland delta in the world: a maze of grasslands, indigenous forests, islands, channels and lakes covering 17,000 square kilometres that teems with all the big game and spectacular birdlife (more than 400 species). Even if youâre not a twitcher, the feathered creatures here are captivating.
The variety of ecosystems in the Okavango make it a fascinating place to safari; one might spot an elephant swimming, see a malachite kingfisher diving, or bump into a lioness.
Thanks to the Botswana government policy of high-revenue, low-volume tourism, there are very few camps or tourists. Nearly all are based near water, on the mainland â in private concessions or in the Moremi National Park â or on islands, and the real draw of the Okavango is the unique water-based safari opportunities it provides: mokoro (dugout canoe) or speedboat excursions through channels and papyrus reedbeds.
Walking (a real treat near water) and night safaris (when cats mostly hunt and nocturnal creatures come out) are only permitted in private concessions â so not the Moremi National Park.
Even flying into the Okavango on a small plane is one of the best things about the holiday; the views over the vast areas of water are breathtaking.

Nearly all are based near water, on the mainland â in private concessions or in the Moremi National Park â or on islands, and the real draw of the Okavango is the unique water-based safari opportunities it provides: mokoro (dugout canoe) or speedboat excursions through channels and papyrus reedbeds.

Walking (a real treat near water) and night safaris (when cats mostly hunt and nocturnal creatures come out) are only permitted in private concessions â so not the Moremi National Park.

Even flying into the Okavango on a small plane is one of the best things about the holiday; the views over the vast areas of water are breathtaking.

The delta is located in north-east Botswana, surrounded by the Kalahari Desert â and almost entirely flat.

Rainwater flows from more than 1,000km away in Angola to the Delta, at its peak covering more than 16,000sq km of land, and 7,000sq km less then this in the dry winter (May to October).

At the heart of the Okavango is the Moremi Game Reserve, where most game grazes all year, in grasslands and thick indigenous forests.

There are five main ethnic groups in the Okavango, as well as a small group of San Bushmen; most camps will be staffed by villages from these tribes.

The Botswana safari industry has been regulated to ensure money goes back into communities, so many camps are often closely linked to a local village and offer visits for guests who want to learn about local traditions.

Masai Mara & Serengeti
Kenya
Destination guide
Alongside the neighbouring Serengeti just south in Tanzania, the Maasai Mara is Kenyaâs finest game reserve and the best place in East Africa for a Big Five safari.
The scenery is spectacular, fringed by an escarpment, dotted with hills, and split by the Mara River, inhabited by those famously enormous crocodiles. Big skies, grasslands stretching to the horizon, acacias silhouetted in the sunset â itâs the stereotypical African scenery most safari-goers dream of.
When the remarkable wildebeest migration passes through its 1,800 square kilometres (from August to October), grasslands heave with millions of wildebeest and zebra â and big prides of lion, as well as hyena, leopard and cheetah, enjoying the moving feast. Itâs a great spectacle, but being among the creatures is like being in a big herd of cows â only millions of them. If theyâre not there, itâs still brilliant.
There is no better way to see the vast expanse of wilderness than from the air – particularly in a floating balloon, at dawn. Expensive, yes, but worth the splurge.
The best way to feel the wild is to be on foot â not permitted in the main reserve. For bushwalking, stay in a neighbouring conservancy and walk with a Maasai. Youâll also be able to visit a village to learn about how man, cattle and wildlife have adapted to live alongside one another â and see the âadumuâ, the famous traditional jumping dance.
The main drawback â itâs uncomfortably touristy. Everyone wants to come here – in high season there will be as many vehicles as animals.

Bordered by the rain-catching (and animal-attracting) Rift Valley escarpment to the west, this vast reserve was called Mara (or ‘spotted’) by the Masai because of the look of its grasslands: dotted with trees, bushes and scrub.

The east, with its Ngama Hills, is the most densely touristed due to its proximity to Nairobi and good roads.

The most popular areas for wildlife-watching are the grassed Mara Triangle, bordering the rivers, and the Central Plains.

Dubrovnik & the Dalmatian Islands
Dalmatia, Croatia
Destination guide
Dubrovnik, often described as the âPearl of the Adriaticâ, has to be one of the worldâs most glorious fortified towns.
A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Dubrovnik is probably Europe’s best example of a late medieval walled city, its architecture and fortifications remarkably well-preserved.
The pedestrian-only Old Town of the former independent Republic of Ragusa (1358-1808) is packed with proud aristocratic buildings, a testament to its past as a wealthy seafaring state.
Aside from outstanding architecture, it offers blissful seascapes, decent pebble beaches, excellent fish restaurants and some of Croatiaâs most luxurious hotels.
Touted as the new Riviera, this picturesque and culture-rich hotspot manages to seduce and accommodate everyone from trendsetters and celebrities to honeymooners and cruise ship passengers.

Regular boats run from Dubrovnik’s old harbour to Cavtatâs quayside, offering a chance to escape the busy city and see a slower-paced, small-town version of Croatian life.Â  Sailing back in the late afternoon, past the rocky cliffs, lush pinewoods and pebble coves of the mainland coast, is idyllic.

Athens
Central Greece, Greece
Destination guide
Beyond the obvious attractionsÂ âÂ yes, the Parthenon does live up to the hypeÂ âÂ Athens has a multitude of unpredictable charms. There are Byzantine churches beside fashionable bars, outdoor cinemas squeezed between apartment blocksÂ andÂ rock concerts in ancient amphitheatres.
The loud, laidback birthplace of democracy has emerged from a tough decade of economic austerity with a renewed creative energy. And the irrepressible locals still know how to party. Some things here will never change â like 300 days of sunshine a year and a 50-kilometre coastline â and they donât cost a thing.

The Acropolis
Athens, Central Greece, Greece
Bucket List Experience
You canât visit Athens without visiting theÂ Acropolis. It is the cityâsÂ iconic citadel andÂ world-famous landmark that wonât fail to amaze even the most jaded traveller.Â Â
âAcropolisâ translates broadly from the Greek words âhighest pointâ or âextremityâ. The site contains half-a-dozen buildings, mostly built from 500 BC to 450 BC on the orders of the powerful statesman Pericles,Â during the so-called âGolden age of Athensâ. Pericles wanted to beautify, glorify and protect the city.Â
TheÂ PathenonÂ
A marble jigsaw made of 70,000 pieces, this 2,500-year-old temple dating back to 438 BC was dedicated to the goddess Athena. It dazzles with perfect symmetry and awe-inspires with its ancient grandeur, even when itâs crawling with tourists. Itâs the most important surviving building of Classical Greece and a symbol of the nation.Â
TheÂ ErechtheionÂ
On the north side of the complex,Â thisÂ Temple of was also dedicated to the goddess Athena, and was built toÂ house the statue of AthenaÂ Polias. More famously today, itâs home to the âPorch of the Maidensâ,Â featuring six sculpted female figures.Â

Acropolis Museum

Decades in the works, the Acropolis Museum opened in 2009. The clunky concrete and glass building has many detractors, but few dispute the magnificence of the collection.
For the first time, all the treasures unearthed on and around the Acropolis are displayed under one roofÂ â except, of course, the âElgin marblesâ, a large section of the famous Parthenon frieze thatâs in the British Museum. Should they be repatriated? Visit the top-floor gallery and decide for yourself.
The museum restaurant matches a great view with great food. Try inventive Greek dishes on aÂ terrace jutting out towards the Parthenon. The glass-walled dining hall also offers stupendous views.

Grand Promenade
Athens, Central Greece, Greece
Bucket List Experience
If you have only a day to spend in Athens, you can cover most of the cityâs âgreatest hitsâ by wandering through the Grand Promenade that rings the Acropolis.
Designed to link all the main sights of ancient Athens in a single pedestrian zone, beautifully landscaped walkways are punctuated by exceptional monuments. There are contemporary attractions, too: al fresco cafÃ©s, street art, and friendly stray dogs.
Start at Hadrianâs Arch. Wander along DionysiouÂ Areopagitou, pausing to take in the ancient amphitheatres Herod Atticus and theÂ Theatre of Dionysus,Â and the modern Acropolis Museum.
Continue onÂ ApostolouÂ PavlouÂ passing the rock ofÂ PnyxÂ on your left where the Athenian citizens used toÂ gather listening to orators from Themistocles to St Paul.
A longer, signposted diversion at the junction of Dionysio Areopagitou and Apostolou Pavlou leads you to the alleged âSocratesâ Prisonâ, and to the top of Philopappou hill with birdâs eye views of the ancient sites below.
Back onÂ ApostolouÂ PavlouÂ and in about 500 yards youâll spot theÂ âThissionâÂ (a misnomer as it was a temple to the god Hephaestus),Â one of theÂ best-preservedÂ Doric temples anywhere in Greece.
Here you can divert into the Agora, the ancient Greeksâ shopping mall and civic hall as well as its fine museum where you can see ceramic voting slips, reminders of the cityâs democratic past.
Backtrack toÂ ThissionÂ and finish at the overlooked cemetery ofÂ Kerameikos, which has an amazing collection of tombstones and statues.

National Archaeological Museum
Athens, Central Greece, Greece
Bucket List Experience
Though recently overshadowed by the newer, flashier Acropolis Museum, this treasure trove of antiquities is equally impressive.

Adult price: Â£5
Good for age: 18+

Plaka
Athens, Central Greece, Greece
Bucket List Experience
Hugging the eastern and northern slopes of the Acropolis is the neighbourhood of âPlakaâ, the cityâs old town heart. This maze of jasmine-scented alleys and colourful neoclassical houses â now protected by a preservation order â has been continuously populated since antiquity.
Strolling through Plaka feels like strolling through a 19th-century film set. Though the areaâs tacky souvenir shops and terrible tavernas teem with tourists, the winding lanes and shaded squares, dotted with Byzantine churches and ancient ruins, have retained their charm.
The northern reaches of Plaka are the prettiest. This maze of whitewashed alleys is called Anafiotika, after the islanders from Anafi who built the capital of newly-independent Greece in 1841.

Delphi Archaeological Site and Museum
Delphi, Central Greece, Greece
Bucket List Experience
One of the most evocative and intriguing archaeological sites in Greece,Â DelphiÂ was the site of the OracleÂ âÂ aÂ pythiaÂ (priestess), who would channel the god Apollo whilst in a trance. Some of her vague prophesies appear in Greek historical texts, others are stillÂ proverbsÂ today.
The extensive site, considered by the ancients to be the Earthâs nave,Â is fullÂ of âtreasuriesâ builtÂ to thank the Oracle. TheÂ excavated,Â superbly fashioned artefacts can be visited inÂ itsÂ must-seeÂ museum.
Alongside the Temple of Apollo and treasuries, the siteâs other main draw is the spectacular theatre, dating back to the 4th century BC, with a capacity of over 5,000.Â Delphi was theÂ locationÂ of the Pythian Games, rivals to the Olympics in antiquity, which took place in the amphitheatre.

Rising to 909 feet, itâs possible to reach the summit by cable car, driving or walking (if youâre up for a challenge). The 19th-century Chapel of St George crowns the top of the hill, a neat whitewashed building thatâs impossible to miss from below.
Next toÂ the chapel,Â theÂ upmarketÂ OrizontesÂ restaurant makes a great place for a long, view-filled lunch.

Sunset at Cape Sounion
Lavrio, Central Greece, Greece
Bucket List Experience
SounionÂ orÂ SounioÂ (the Sacred Cape of the Athenians according to Homer) lies at the southernmost tip of the Attic peninsula. Marked by the partly-renovated temple of Poseidon set on a steep, 200-ft high precipice,Â SounionÂ is evidence that the Ancient Greeks chose the locations of their temples with immaculate taste.
The temple crowns the summit of an ancient fortified settlement, with six-foot walls, erected by the city-state of Athens for strategic purposes. It occupies around ten acres in total; a port was located at the sandy cove to the north of the fortress.
This is the spot whereÂ âÂ according to mythÂ âÂ KingÂ AegeasÂ awaitedÂ the return of his sonÂ Thissias, who had beenÂ dispatched toÂ kill the Minotaur. When heÂ saw his ship bearingÂ blackÂ sailsÂ â hisÂ son had forgotten to swap them âÂ heÂ committed suicideÂ by falling into the sea,Â thus naming the Aegean.
The legend, the temple, plus the unfettered pelagic views all come together in one of Greeceâs most renowned sunsets â an experience not to be missed.

Marathon (Marathonas)
Marathon, Central Greece, Greece
Bucket List Experience
An unassuming small town in Attica, Marathon is famous as the site of a victorious battle for the Greek army, when they defeated the Persians in 490 BC. Some credit this victory as signalling the beginning of Western civilisation, which then flourished in ancient Greece.
Three ancient tumuli (large raised common graves), rising to 40ft, mark the site where the most ancient battle ever recorded was fought. It was the runner Pheidippides who ran the 42.195km to Athens, in full armour, to deliver the triumphant news, a feat that gave the name to the modern Olympic race. Having delivered the message, he promptly died.
This is a must for anyone interested in AncientÂ Greek History.Â Some credit this victory as signalling the beginning of Western civilisation, which then flourished in ancient Greece.Â and is especially poignant for those who have run a marathon; somehow it brings perspective to all the pain suffered in the race.

The Roman Forum
Athens, Central Greece, Greece

Marrakech
Marrakech-Safi, Morocco
Destination guide
Note from Matt: Please do still consider travelling to Marrakech and the Atlas mountains, despite the devastation caused by the earthquake. The local people are heavily dependent on tourism and will suffer further if tourists stop visiting. Marrakech sustained some damage, but the souks and Jamaa el-Fnaa are still open and buzzing and the spirit of the people is unbowed. Indeed, according to people I know who have been recently, it’s quite inspiring to see how they are fighting back in the face of adversity…
Moroccoâs former capital blends buzzing street life with atmospheric architecture and vibrant Arab culture, suffused with a liberal sprinkling of French influence â which adds up to an exotic,Â  intoxicating and entirely unique holiday destination.
Known as the Red Rose city, thanks to the dusky pink hue of its buildings, Marrakech is best known for its UNESCO World Heritage-listed Medina (Old City), which is packed with souks and completely encircled by five-metre thick walls, built a thousand years ago.
Visitors can expect beautiful boutique hotels set in old riads, a flourishing food scene and a vibrant shopping experience.

Jemaa El Fna
Marrakech, Marrakech-Safi, Morocco
Bucket List Experience
Marrakechâs UNESCO World Heritage-listed central square epitomises the exotic allure of the city. From dawn until well after dusk it hums with activity, like an open-air theatre.
The scene here has changed little down the centuries; snake charmers, Gnaoua musicians, magicians and myriad other performers congregate here, mainly for local audiences â though at peak times it’s very touristy.
By early evening part of the square becomes a giant open-air kitchen and is given over to countless food stalls serving local specialities. The Medina’s famous souks start on its fringes.
Good for age: 8+

Souks of the Medina
Marrakech, Marrakech-Safi, Morocco
Bucket List Experience
With more than 2,500 stalls and shops crammed into a labyrinth of narrow streets, which in turn are also rammed with people, donkeys and mopeds, it’s easy to feel intimidated in the souks. Donât be. Virtually every type of trade and craft is being practiced here; there are blacksmiths, carpenters, weavers, carpet sellers, purveyors of magic potions and natural cosmetics, fruit and vegetable traders and many more.
To visit the souks is to experience the real heart of this ancient city. There are other souks in Morocco but this is one of Moroccoâs liveliest and most special.
Good for age: 13+

Stay in a traditional riad
Marrakech, Marrakech-Safi, Morocco
Bucket List Experience
Thereâs no better way to immerse yourself in Moroccan life than staying in a riad; the traditionally-designed townhouses that line the twisting alleyways of the medina. Rooms are set around an internal courtyard â traditionally divided into four quarters, with a small fountain at the centre and filled with plants and greenery.
Traditionally, Islam forbids any external show of wealth when it comes to property, so all riads â even the most upscale and ornate â are hidden behind plain walls. This adds to the tantalising sense of stepping into a hidden oasis; riads are designed to be cool and quiet â a cocoon from the frenetic streets outside.
Riads vary hugely in style; many have swapped the traditional mosaic tiling and tadelakt plasterwork for a more contemporary, minimalist feel, but what almost all have in common is a rooftop terrace. These are the places to experience Moroccan a sunset, when the Atlas Mountains shimmer in the distance and the call to prayer echoes up from the mosques; Marrakech at its bewitching, enigmatic best.
Adult price: Â£20

Safaris in the Sahara Desert
Draa-Tafilalet, Morocco
Bucket List Experience
Over 9.2 million sq km (larger than either the US or China) of nothing but vast, shifting sand dunes, the world’s largest hot desert covers most of Northern Africa. Average daily temperatures can reach 47Â°C â only Death Valley can rival it.
Mute and empty, beneath flawless blue skies, the Sahara Desert is like nowhere else in Morocco (or indeed the world).
But don’t let that put you off. Joining a safari into the desert is an evocative, unearthly and sometimes surreal experience, and the chance to sleep and wake in one of the worldâs most extreme and beautiful landscapes.
At 450 kilometres from Marrakech, reaching the edge of the Sahara Desert takes at least 10 hours by car, and is an adventure in itself. Once in the desert, the journey continues by camel to a comfortable camp (some camps offer 4×4 transfers if preferred).
Sunset camel treks are a must-do, with the sky flaming pink and purple before fading into inky darkness. Piping hot tajines appear at mealtimes, with many camps offering fireside musical entertainment before guests retreat to a luxury tent, complete with en suite bathrooms and proper beds.
Adult price: Â£100

Dinner in the Agafay Desert (& camel ride)
Agafay Desert, Marrakech-Safi, Morocco
Bucket List Experience
The Agafay Desert, with its gentle rolling hills, the odd palm tree dotting the landscape, and the Atlas Mountains hovering in the background (snow-capped during winter months), is a complete contrast to bustling Marrakech just 45 minutes away. Trekking across the lunar-like landscapes, before dinner beneath the star-scattered desert sky is a memorable and unique experience.
Your evening begins with a 45-minute guided camel trek, transporting guests from the desert outskirts to a luxury camp, where dinner â a selection of Moroccan salads followed by tajine or grilled meats â is served with a view. Dinner is served under the starry sky or inside a traditional Bedouin tent, depending on the season. Evenings often include local musicians who play traditional songs with infectious, vibrant rhythms.
Several luxury camps provide glamping options for travellers looking for an overnight option.

However, it was under the Saadian rulers in the 1560s that the school was renovated to the extraordinary level that visitors can marvel at today.Â Â
The Andalusian architectural details, such as the stucco plasterwork featuring Arabic inscriptions and the colourful mosaics, are wonderfully preserved and worth taking time to appreciate.Â

Hammams in Marrakech
Marrakech, Marrakech-Safi, Morocco
Bucket List Experience
The hammam (steam bathhouse) has been an integral part of Islamic, notably Arabic, culture for centuries. Inspired by the Roman thermae, a bathhouse would include a cold room, a warm room and a hot room; in the latter, heat is produced by furnaces to supply hot water and steam.
The signature Marrakech hammam experience starts with a stint in the steam room, but then progresses to a special detoxication treatment; first, a scrub with locally-made black soap (containing olive oil) to prepare the skin for a gommage (exfoliation) with a kessa glove. After, locally-sourced rhassoul clay is applied, followed by a massage with local Argan oil.
For locals, a visit to the bathhouse is more than just a spa treatment. It serves three key purposes: one for hygiene, second for cleansing for before religious ablution before prayer, and third as a meeting place for the local community.
Adult price: Â£20

Marrakechâs best food & drink
Marrakech, Marrakech-Safi, Morocco
Bucket List Experience
Moroccan cuisine is best known for its slow-cooked tajines â richly flavoured stews, cooked on traditional platters with conical lids â and heaped platters of couscous topped with seven vegetables.
More traditional meals usually start with a tray of meze â fresh salads that might include honeyed carrot salad, humous, roasted aubergine and yoghurt with mint and garlic. Lamb is the most popular meat, while seafood, such as sardines, are plucked straight from the Atlantic in Essaouira.
Mint tea is another obligatory Moroccan ritual drunk at any time of the day, often taken with a plate of sugar-topped biscuits, or syrup-drenched pastries. Moroccans have an extremely sweet tooth, and there are excellent patisseries dotted around the Ville Nouvelle â a legacy of the French Colonial era.

The permanent collection features enviable evening gowns, capes and pantsuits divided by collection, while an impressive curiosity cabinet is filled with accessories to complete the looks. In the theatre, footage from previous fashion shows and interviews is shown on a loop.

Madrid
Madrid Region, Spain
Destination guide
Maybe itâs the bright sunshine that lights up the city’s majestic plazas for most of the year â even in winter â but Madrid always seems to have that feel-good factor.
Some visit Spainâs capital for its three world-class art museums â the Prado, the Reina Sofia and the Thyssen â but most simply come for the exceptional food, great boutique shopping and vibrant nightlife. Indeed, there are few world capitals where itâs so easy to slip into the local way of life.
This is one place where even the best-laid sightseeing plans are likely to go astray.

Prado Museum
Madrid, Community of Madrid, Spain
Bucket List Experience
One of the finest museums in the world, the Prado was originally meant to be a museum of natural science. However, by the time it was completed in 1819, its purpose had shifted to that of a grand art exhibition space. Today, based on the former Spanish Royal Collection, it is the single best collection of Spanish art and arguably the world’s finest collection of European art, dating from the 12th century to the early 20th century.
Its vast galleries are packed with household-name masterpieces and heavyweight artists â the stars of the show being Velazquez, El Greco and Goya. The hugely impressive permanent collection comprises around 8,000+ drawings, 7,600+ paintings, 4,800+ prints, and 1,000+ sculptures â though at any one time, only 1,300 works are displayed in the main building due to capacity constraints.
There are usually also several world-class temporary exhibitions running alongside the permanent collection.

World-class art in Madrid
Madrid, Community of Madrid, Spain
Bucket List Experience
This vibrant city was the epicentre of Spainâs 16th- and 17th-century âGolden Ageâ, when the kings and clergy patronised artists such as Velazquez, Murillo, Zurbaran and El Greco, and couldnât purchase enough paintings by Titian, Hieronymus Bosch, Rubens and others.
Then, in the 19th century, came Picasso and Goya; the latterâs portraits of the Spanish royal family, Madridâs citizens, its fiestas and demons are seared into the cityâs soul.
The result was an unrivalled hoard of artistic treasure that you can see in the âTriangle of Artâ â the Prado, Thyssen-Bornemisza and Reina Sofia museums. These three are home to scores of masterpieces and each rank among the worldâs greatest art museums. The Reina Sofia is home to arguably the most famous painting of the 20th century, Picassoâs Guernica.
If you have time for more, the Real Academia de Bellas Artes, the Lazaro Galdiano Museum and the Ermita de San Antonio de la Florida wonât disappoint â in any other city, theyâd be top attractions.

World-class art in Amsterdam
Amsterdam , North Holland, Netherlands
Bucket List Experience
Amsterdam has a rich artistic heritage that stretches back centuries. In the 1600s, now known as the Dutch Golden Age, wealth flowed into the city, and prosperous merchants commissioned paintings and portraits, to decorate the walls of their gabled mansions. Artists set up workshops to meet the demand, including Rembrandt in the capital and Frans Hals in nearby Haarlem.
No surprise then that the city is now home to three of the worldâs leading art museums â all within walking distance of one another.
Perhaps no Dutch artist is more revered than Van Gogh, and though he lived only briefly in Amsterdam, itâs here that you can see the largest collection of his works â some 200 paintings and 400 drawings â at his namesake museum. The nearby Rijksmuseum houses an unparalleled collection of Old Masters, including Rembrandtâs celebrated ‘The Night Watch’ and four paintings by Vermeer.
The 20th century saw important Dutch art movements such as De Stijlâ¯and CoBrA, whose influence spread far beyond the countryâs borders. A stellar assortment of these works â including the precise, primary-colour-blocked paintings of De Stijlâ¯founder Piet Mondrian â can be seen at the Stedelijk Museum, which also holds a first-rate modern and contemporary collection by international artists.

Anne Frank House
Amsterdam, North Holland, Netherlands
Bucket List Experience
Just after Amsterdam resident Anne Frankâs 13th birthday in 1942, she and her family went into hiding to escape Jewish persecution under the Nazis. They lived hidden away in a cramped annexe for two years, until they were betrayed and transported to concentration camps. Only Anneâs father Otto survived.
During their period of hiding in Amsterdam, Anne Frank kept a remarkable diary, given to her as a 13th birthday present by her father. After the war, Otto Frank managed to retrieve his daughterâs diary and find a willing publisher. The book became an international sensation.
The house â with cramped annexe â is now Amsterdamâs most popular museum, with Anneâs original red-checked diary on display, alongside the notebooks in which she wrote short stories and quotations. A new exhibition, âA Room Full of Dreamsâ displays the pictures and postcards she stuck on her bedroom walls.
The museum also offers a special 30-minute programme for those who want an introduction to the story of Anne Frank.
Itâs a poignant, moving experience, and an Amsterdam must-see.

Hermitage Amsterdam
Amsterdam, North Holland, Netherlands
Bucket List Experience
A 17th-century old peopleâs home by the Amstel River has been cleverly converted into exhibition spaces to display exquisite treasures from the vast collections of St Petersburg’s State Hermitage Museum.
Some of the collections focus on Russian history and culture, others on wider European art â recent and forthcoming exhibitions have included masterpiece Impressionist paintings. Usually, two blockbuster exhibitions take place each year.
It may seem odd that Amsterdam is home to such fine Russian art, but Amsterdam has a special relationship with Russia â Peter the Great once lived in the city, and it inspired him to build St Petersburg. He founded the original Hermitage Museum using exhibits collected while in Amsterdam.

Amsterdamâs best food & drink
Amsterdam, North Holland, Netherlands
Bucket List Experience
Dutch food has a reputation for being stodgy, but has undergone a renaissance in recent years.
In 2022, Amsterdam counted 19 Michelin-starred establishments, while across the board, restaurant kitchens have embraced local ingredients â from regionally grown produce to locally raised beef to fresh seafood from the North Sea.
Non-Dutch eateries predominate in multicultural Amsterdam and the diverse array of international offerings continues to grow. French, Italian, Japanese, Asian-fusion and Mediterranean are among the most popular, while the thriving immigrant communities in East Amsterdam â namely Indonesian, Ethiopian, Surinamese, and Turkish â have brought their cuisine to the capital.
Indonesian restaurants are particularly prevalent â the Dutch East India Company introduced the cuisine into Holland in the 17th century. The rijstaffel, or rice table, is a staple here; it features dozens of small plates â everything from spicy grilled satay to egg rolls to fried coconut â all served with plain white rice.

Amsterdam, North Holland, Netherlands
Bucket List Experience
The Dutch were a naval superpower in the 17th century, a period of their history known as the Golden Age, when the Netherlands was the centre of international trade.

Kingâs Day
Amsterdam, North Holland, Netherlands
Experience
Amsterdam holds a massive city-wide street party every year to mark the birthday of King Willem-Alexander.
Orange-clad Dutch people (and visitors) cram the streets, parks and canals, which become clogged with boats. There is free live outdoor music everywhere, and the city becomes one giant flea market, with many an Amsterdammer trying to flog unwanted second-hand things â great for collectors. The preceding evening, King’s Night, is a big night across the city’s bars and clubs.
Wearing orange is de rigueur on Kingâs Day, even for visitors. Expect the whole city to be garish orange, from clothes and wigs to banners and food. The orange craze is a reference to the Dutch royal family â the House of Orange.
Itâs colourful and great fun if you like to party and socialise, but for others itâs crowded, messy and noisy (and many locals flee the city until itâs over). Amsterdam is jam-packed, with some 800,000 extra visitors to the city â and be prepared for lots of inebriated Dutchmen.
Note from Matt: If you don’t like crowds, don’t go. The streets throng and it’s hard to get around. But the atmosphere is buzzing, and there are mini-concerts and entertainment all around town. My tip – find a spot you like and stay there. As the day wears on, the crowds thin and spontaneous little street parties break out all around the town, where you can dance the night away if you like to party. Anyone is welcome to stop and join in. Teens and twenties will love it.

Flamenco in Andalusia
Andalusia, Spain
Bucket List Experience
Andalusia expresses its passionate soul in the guitars, singing and twirling, stamping steps of its native flamenco â declared Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO in 2010.
Most scholars believed the seeds of flamenco arrived in the 15th century with the Roma from India. Over the centuries they slowly migrated west with their castanets and tambourines, absorbing songs and dances in the Middle East and North Africa along the way. The Spanish at first considered it a foreign art, or âFlemishâ â hence flamenco.
By the 19th century flamenco as we know it emerged â popularized by Bizetâs Carmen â with shows performed in cafÃ©s cantantes (singersâ cafÃ©s), the forerunners to the modern tablaos. These are intimate venues with small wooden stages, perfect for the exhilarating machine gun-like zapateado (dancing).
You can hear flamencoâs eastern origins in the singerâs cante jondo (âdeep songâ), evoking pain, sorrow and joy, while dancers express each emotion with their bodies, driven by the pulsing percussive strumming of the guitars.
A good show, and there are many here, can send chills down your spine with their duende, the ecstatic âdemonâ spirit that brings listeners out of themselves.

Mezquita of Cordoba
Cordoba, Andalusia, Spain
Bucket List Experience
Begun in the year 785, whenÂ AbdÂ arÂ Rahman IÂ made Cordoba the capital ofÂ al-Andalus, theÂ Mezquita (Mosque-Cathedral). is a breathtaking tour de force designed to show that this western outpost of Islam was equal to anything in the east.
ItsÂ seemingly endless columns,Â horseshoe archesÂ andÂ beautifulÂ double archesÂ meltÂ intoÂ distant shadows.Â Originally open on the sides, withÂ light pouring in, it was walled-in when the Christians built a cathedral in the centre, itself aÂ treasure-filledÂ masterpiece although it seems intrusive in this magical forestÂ of 580Â columns,Â this pure meditation in stone.

Alcazar of Seville
Seville, Andalusia, Spain
Bucket List Experience
Built in the 10th century for Sevilleâs Moorish governor, the Alcazar was converted into a palace by Pedro I, Christian King of Castile in the 1360s, making it the oldest royal palace still in use in Europe.
Pedro brought in Moorish craftsmen from Granada and Toledo to create his dream home, and today their patios, tile work, tracery and arabesques are the most delightful features, culminating in the stunning Salon de Embajadores, where Charles V was married in 1526.
Charles later added his own palace to the Alcazar, decorated with priceless Flemish tapestries. And the gardens are simply enchanting.

For thrills, chills and hopefully no spills, this vertiginous walkway, pinned 100m above ground to the walls of the narrow gorge, has become one of Andalusiaâs top bucket list attractions.
Originally built in concrete in 1905 for hydroelectric plant workers, it earned its name, the âKingâs Little Pathâ in 1921 when Alfonso XIII walked it to open the Conde del Guadalhorce dam.

Ronda
Ronda, Andalusia, Spain
Bucket List Experience
Once impregnable Ronda is the only city in the wildly beautiful Serrania de Ronda between Malaga and Seville, and makes for a fine day trip.
Teetering on sheer cliffs, Rondaâs extraordinary Puente Nuevo straddles the 150m deep Tajo gorge, linking the old Moorish town to the new. The views alone make it Andalusiaâs third most visited city, but there is much more, including the Palacio de Mondragon Museum and gardens, the city walls and gates.
Ronda is also a gateway to a series of so-called White Villages (Pueblos Blancos) â 20 hill towns in the Sierra de Grazalema named after their glowing white-washed walls, immersed in lovely landscapes. There are several circular White Village routes out of Ronda, or en route to Cadiz or Jerez de la Frontera.Â Ideal for leisurely touring by car or bike.

Sherry tasting in Jerez
Jerez de la Frontera, Andalusia, Spain
Bucket List Experience
Jerez de la Frontera is synonymous with sherry (the very word is an Anglicization of Xeres or Jerez), and according to DOP regulations it can only be made in the âSherry triangleâ â Jerez, Sanlucar de Barrameda and El Puerto de Santa Maria.
Made with white Palomino grapes, the wine is then fortified to various degrees, from pale dry Fino and Manzanilla to Oloroso and the very sweet, very alcoholic (up to 22%) Pedro Ximenez.
Many of the bodegas (wine cellars) have a British connection, a love affair that began in 1587 when Sir Francis Drake brought back 2,900 barrels of sherry after destroying the Spanish navy in Cadiz. The tours, some including serious tastings, food and even art, are fascinating; the grandest bodegas are breath-taking wine cathedrals.

Andalusiaâs best food & drink
Andalusia, Spain
Bucket List Experience
Andalusian cooking is renowned for fresh seafood, olives and olive oil, sun-ripened vegetables, garlic and paprika.
Cooking is simple, letting fresh, delicious ingredients speak for themselves. Much of the preparation in the kitchen is minimal â fish is usually lightly dredged in flour and golden fried in olive oil.
Cold soups star in summer, hearty stews in the winter and melt-in-your-mouth cured ham (jamon serrano) year-round. Many of the desserts, many involving almonds, go back to Arab times.
Sangria, as elsewhere in Spain, is a popular drink, as is sherry. Andalusia is home to Jerez de la Frontera, the world’s sherry capital â go for tours and tastings.

Hammams of Andalusia
Andalusia, Spain
Bucket List Experience
Of all the Moorish memories in Andalusia, the baths are one thing you can truly experienceÂ asÂ the locals did centuriesÂ ago.Â
The Arabs learned about baths from the Romans, and built them throughout Andalusia, but the Christians of the Reconquista thought cleanliness was sinful and closed them down. In 1998, they began to reopen, first in Granada; others have been newly built in historic buildings, and recreate them in spirit.
Each offers theÂ ancientÂ ArabicÂ bathÂ ritualÂ inÂ alternating cold, warm and hotÂ pools, as well as extraÂ massage options, includingÂ classic Moroccan exfoliatingÂ kessaÂ essential oilÂ massage andÂ black soapÂ scrubÂ on a hot stone.Â Â

April Fair
Seville, Andalusia, Spain
Bucket List Experience
After all the solemnity of Holy Week (Semana Santa), Seville lets its hair down for a week-long party â Feria de Abril, or April Fair.
It starts on a Monday, with a fish feast and the midnight illumination of the thousands of lights of the gate to the Real de la Feria fairgroundsÂ on the far bank of the Guadalquivir. Here over a thousand striped tents, (theÂ casetas),Â are set up, for socializing, tapas,Â rebujitoÂ (sherry with lemon soda) and dancingÂ sevillanas, the local flamenco.
The streets are decorated with thousands of lanterns; nearly everyoneÂ isÂ dressed in traditional costume, theÂ womenÂ inÂ long, ruffle-fringedÂ trajeÂ deÂ gitanaÂ (flamenco dresses)Â with flowers or lace mantillas in their hair; and the nearby funfair in Calle delÂ InfiernoÂ reverberates with screams of laughter.
In the afternoon watch theÂ paseoÂ de caballos, the spectacular parade of Seville high society in traditional traje corto (riding dress) â wide-brimmed hats, short jackets, tight trousers, boots and hats. The horses are just as exquisitely-groomed horses with ornate, often flower-covered bridles.

TheÂ area first fell in love with horsesÂ in the 8thÂ century,Â when the BerbersÂ from North Africa brought their proud Arab steeds to Andalusia. Afterwards they were bred by Carthusian monks in Jerez, creating the strong,Â slender pale grey AndalusianÂ Pura Raza Espanola breed, with their elegantly arched necks.Â TheÂ dressage school was founded in 1973, and has become a must-see in Jerez ever since.

Chateau Chenonceau
Chenonceaux, Centre-Val de Loire, France
Bucket List Experience
Chenonceau is widely known as the âladies’ chateauâ, owing to the succession of extraordinary women integral to its history.
Built in 1513 by Katherine BriÃ§onnet, it was given by Henri II to his mistress, the legendary beauty Diane de Poitiers, before his widow Catherine de MÃ©dicis grabbed it back after his death.
It was then inherited by Louise de Lorraine, wife of Henry III, the third son of Catherine of Medicis. After Henry IIIâs assassination, a traumatised Louise de Lorraine turned to prayer, becoming known as âthe white lady of Chenonceauâ. Last, but not least, it was saved during the French Revolution by then-owner Madame Dupin, who managed to reason with the mob.
The Loire’s most visited chateau can feel overrun, yet remains magical for the sheer ingenuity of its spanning the River Cher, for its fine late Gothic and Renaissance architecture, and for outstanding collections of furniture and art.

Thousands of kilometres of tunnels â originally dug out of the soft, underlying, tufa strata as part of Middle Age stone quarries â became chapels, houses and farms to create the largest troglodyte region in Europe. Some are still lived in, while others have been converted into hotels and restaurants, dramatic wine cellars (providing ideal conditions for storing wine), mushroom farms and even a zoo.

The undisputed star of the show, however, is the stupendous kitchen garden, transformed into a geometrical feast of cabbages and pumpkins, zigzags of leeks, patches of peppers and other colourful vegetables.

Chateau Cheverny
Cheverny, Centre-Val de Loire, France
Bucket List Experience
Built in 1624-30, this chateau is still lived in by descendants of the original owners and builders, the Hurault family. Unlike the Renaissance style of many Loire chateaux, here you are firmly in the comforts of Louis XIII classicism, amid lavish panelling and fine tapestries.
The chateau is regarded as being one of the most richly decorated and furnished; the interiors have remained largely untouched, with an impressive assortment of furniture, tapestries, weapons and other artefacts that reveal six centuries of family history.
The chateau still maintains a kennel of more than 100 hounds, in keeping with a strong hunting tradition. You can visit them all day, but the main spectacle is feeding time at 5pm, or 3pm in winter months.
Pair a visit here with some excellent wine tasting at the Maison des Vins near the entrance. Visit in spring to see a rainbow of over 250,000 tulips. Seven gardeners work all year round on this natural display.

Hike along Santoriniâs caldera
Santorini, Greek Islands, Greece
Bucket List Experience
AÂ 6-mile hike along the rim of Santoriniâs caldera, this relatively easy three-hour trek is one of the most memorable in the whole of the Aegean. The route linksÂ Fira, the islandâs capital, withÂ Oia, its most picturesque village.
Walking the caldera â the rim of a sunken volcanic crater â is the best way to appreciate the islandâs unique geographyÂ and to soak up those spectacular landscapes. As you walk, youâll see whitewashed houses perched on vertiginous slopes, and colourful, striated caldera cliffs that plummet into the azure sea.

Knossos
Crete, Greek Islands, Greece
Bucket List Experience
Knossos is one of the most important archaeological sites in Greece, the largest Bronze Age archaeological site on Crete, and is known as Europe’s oldest city, dating back to the Neolithic period.
It was the palace of King Minos, founder of the Minoan civilisation that flourished 4,000 years ago. This is also where Theseus slayed the mythical Minotaur, after navigating through the labyrinth with the help of Minosâ daughter, Ariadne.
The size of a small town, the palace itself resembles a labyrinth. With its stunning frescoes, mosaics, ceramic vessels, and painted columns, the site is remarkably well preserved (though some archaeologists object to Arthus Evansâ partial reconstructions of the site).
Adult price: Â£5
Good for age: 13+

Hike to the Kameni Volcano
Santorini, Greek Islands, Greece
Bucket List Experience
Cruising the islandâs half-submerged, cliff-rimmed volcanic crater is like floating in an open-air geological museum.
A full-day boat trip takes in three equally extraordinary attractions: climbing the charred, hissing crater of Palia Kameni, wallowing in the sulphurous hot springs of Nea Kameni, then shinning up the steep islet of Thirassia, a charming time warp miraculously overlooked by mass tourism.

Hike Samaria Gorge
Crete, Greek Islands, Greece
Bucket List Experience
Running from a plateau in the White Mountains all the way down to the Libyan Sea, Samaria Gorge is one of the longest and most spectacular canyons in Europe.
Well-trodden and well-maintained, the 16-kilometre trail goes through incredibly diverse scenery. You might spot some of the 450 species of flora and fauna, alongside freshwater springs, abandoned villages, and isolated chapels. Look out for the increasingly rare kri-kri goats, an endangered breed endemic to Crete.
It’s possible to hike a much shorter route, if you start at the end point: the coastal village of Agia Roumeli, where you can cool off with a plunge into the Libyan Sea.
Good for age: 8+
Duration: 1 day

Hike Aradena Gorge
Crete, Greek Islands, Greece
Bucket List Experience
There are dozens of gorges on Crete; so if youâre looking for a shorter (and less busy) alternative to Samaria, the Aradena gorge ticks all the boxes.
The 7.5-km trail takes you from the ghost village of Aradena (abandoned in the 1950s, after a bloody vendetta between two local families), along very old, cobbled mule tracks (called kalderimia), crisscrossing the riverbed and climbing up and down the sheer cliffs. The rock face is covered in tiny flowers in spring. (Be warned: you need a head for heights.)
The route ends at the pebble cove of Marmara on the Libyan Sea. This beautiful, hard-to-reach beach is also home to a fantastic taverna.
Good for age: 8+
Duration: 2-3 hours

Wine tasting in Santorini
Santorini, Greek Islands, Greece
Bucket List Experience
Santoriniâs arid, volcanic terrain produces some of Greeceâs finest winesÂ â a tradition that dates back more than 3,500 years.Â The practice of cultivating vines inÂ niabelosÂ (specially pruned baskets) to protect the grapes from the harsh winters also dates back centuries.
There are ten professional wineries and several smaller concessions on Santorini. The bone-dry, citrus-and-smoke Assyrtiko,Â AidaniÂ andÂ AthiriÂ whites, and smooth, sweet Vin Santo are the islandâs most famous exports.

Sunset at Oia
Santorini, Greek Islands, Greece
Bucket List Experience
The character-filled town ofÂ OiaÂ stands at the north-western tip ofÂ Santoriniâs own little archipelago,Â withÂ postcard-perfect views west and south.Â AtÂ sunset, the soft pinks and pumice-grey strata of the caldera walls turn to deep crimson and pewter, with the sea beneath deepening from shimmering azure to aÂ dark indigoÂ abyss.
Regrettably,Â OiaâsÂ main streetÂ becomesÂ shoulder-to-shoulder crowded,Â soÂ come early and walk to theÂ westernmostÂ pointÂ andÂ theÂ rocky promontoryÂ furtherÂ beyond. Later arrivals will act as a natural barrier,Â and yourÂ gaze will remainÂ relatively unencumbered.
Another option is toÂ book at a restaurant or cafÃ©Â (with views)Â beforehand. The best placeÂ is the King Neptune restaurant, whose terrace stands above the throngs below. Itâs a good-value family taverna with traditional staples such as moussaka, and its sunset location canât be matched.
Good for age: 18+
Duration: 1-2 hours

Corfu Historic Centre
Corfu, Greek Islands, Greece

Balos Beach [sailing]
Crete, Greek Islands, Greece

Acropolis of Lindos
Rhodes, Greek Islands, Greece
Experience
Rising in a dramatic setting, up a 116m high clifftop and a stiff climb from Lindos village, the Lindos Acropolis dedicated to the goddess Athena is the best-preserved archaeological site in the Dodecanese.

Good for age: 18+

Portara, Temple of Apollo
Naxos, Greek Islands, Greece
Experience
The conspicuous ‘Gate to Nowhere’ should have led to the never-completed Temple of Apollo, but today itâs is the perfect place to watch the glorious Aegean sunsets. It was allegedly built on the spot where the cad Theseus abandoned faithful Ariadne whoâd helped him kill the Minotaur.
Good for age: 13+

Spinalonga
Crete, Greek Islands, Greece
Experience
Lepers were once marooned on this tiny island opposite Elounda. Uninhabited since 1957, itâs now a haunting national monument, accessible by fishing boat or on a day cruise. Go early: the crowds and heat get pretty intense by midday.

Experience
This creepy cavern is where St. John the Evangelist had his apocalyptic revelations (which became the last book of the New Testament). Adorned with 12th-century wall paintings and shimmering icons, the sacred grotto is often packed with Greek pilgrims, as well as day trippers from the many cruise ships that service Patmos.
Good for age: 18+

Agios Pavlos Beach
Rhodes, Greek Islands, Greece
Experience
Maybe the most picturesque of bays on the island, this is the cove that St. Paul was shipwrecked on during his proselytising voyages. Up towards the Acropolis you can discern the Cave Of The Virgin that served as a secret Christian place of worship, complete with 3rd-century inscriptions.
Good for age: 4+

Greek Orthodox Easter
Patmos, Greek Islands, Greece
Bucket List Experience
Easter is the biggest event in the Greek calendar, and itâs celebrated on Patmos with great pomp.
Pilgrims throng to the island to attend liturgies in the Cave of the Apocalypse; on Easter Thursday, the Abbot bathes the feet of a dozen monks in imitation of the Last Supper; and on Easter Sunday, the Second Resurrection is read in seven languages and red eggs are handed to the congregation.
Easter on Patmos offers a unique immersion into Greek culture, but itâs deeply traditional and almost exclusively attended by locals and Greek pilgrims, so donât expect to party.

Monastery of St John [Hiking]
Patmos, Greek Islands, Greece

Fishing tours on the Regina
Paros, Greek Islands, Greece
Experience
The Regina is a wooden kaiki (fishing boat) available for slow cruises from Aliki. The skipper, Dimitris Skiadas, comes from a long line of local fishermen and knows the Aegean inside out.

Chorio
Symi, Greek Islands, Greece
Experience
Chorio, the upper town, offers a glimpse of bygone Greece with its faded 18th-century mansions and narrow stone archways, and is ideal for a lazy wander.
Simply walk up the 500-odd steps of Kali Strata, the handsome walkway that connects Yialos to Chorio. Once there, stop by for a look at the fine collection of Byzantine and medieval artefacts in the local museum. Nearby, the Hatziagapitos mansion contains ornately carved wooden chests and frescoes.
At the pinnacle is Symiâs ancient acropolis, with vertiginous views of the harbour.

Good for age: 4+

Symiâs secret beaches
Symi, Greek Islands, Greece
Experience
Boat trips to remote beaches are a major highlight of a visit to Symi â notably the dazzling pebble beaches along the islandâs east coast.
Nanou, Marathounda and Agios Giorgos Dysalona all have translucent water and a ravishingly wild setting (albeit with sunbeds and umbrellas for shade).
Agios Giorgos Dysalona is the wildest of all, backed by a 300-metre sheer cliff, which means the shade comes early here. Nanou is a long stretch of white pebbles with an excellent little canteen for lunch.
The taverna at sheltered Marathouda Bay is equally lovely. A herd of peckish (and very friendly) goats roam the pebble beach in search of snacks. Marathouda is also accessible by car; the bus that takes you to the Panormitis Monastery also stops here.
More easily accessible on foot from Yalos, Nos, Nimborio, and Pedi are also pleasant swimming spots, but likely to be a lot more crowded.
Local Symi travel specialist Kalodoukas arrange excursions aboard the Agios Nikolaos, a beautiful wooden caique. The fare includes a buffet lunch.
Good for age: 8+

Creteâs best food & drink
Crete, Greek Islands, Greece
Bucket List Experience
Seasonal, local, and traditional, Cretan food is phenomenally fresh and tasty. With its balmy climate and diverse landscape, the island produces a vast range of amazing produce, from olive oil, honey, wine, and cheese, to more atypical crops such as avocadoes, bananas, and mangoes.
Grilled, roast, or stewed meat is much loved by locals, particularly goat and lamb, which is often free-range. Thereâs less of a fishing industry than on smaller islands.
Cretans are generous hosts. Portions are generally huge, and youâll be offered shots of raki (local grappa) wherever you go.

Windsurfing at Golden Beach
Paros, Greek Islands, Greece
Experience
Over half a mile long, Golden Beach catches the north wind, so the sea is often choppy.

Psili Ammos beach
Patmos, Greek Islands, Greece
Experience
Patmos is short on sandy beaches, but Psili Ammos (meaning âfine sandâ) is a gem. Itâs only accessible by water taxi from Skala or a one-hour hike over the hills from Grikos, rewarded by ice-cold beer and stewed goat at the shady taverna on arrival.

Palace of the Grand Master
Rhodes, Greek Islands, Greece
Experience

More than a religious landmark, this 16th-century monastery is a symbol of the Cretan struggle for independence from Ottoman rule.

Florence
Tuscany, Italy
Destination guide
Recognised as the birthplace of the Renaissance, Florence harbours an estimated one million works of art, some 70 museums and more than 60 churches crammed into a compact plain surrounded by on three sides by hills.
The cityâs small size (pop. 365,000) makes it simple to navigate, while its 11 million annual visitors guarantee a constant buzz, although during peak season, the sheer volume of tourists can seem overwhelming.
This being Tuscany, food and wine are of primary importance, and there are restaurants galore, from authentic, family-run trattorias to outposts of gourmet, new-wave Tuscan cuisine. Florence is also famed for its fashion brands: Pucci, Gucci and Ferragamo all started here. With so much to see, this capital of culture merits multiple visits.

World-class art in Florence
Florence, Tuscany, Italy
Bucket List Experience
With around a million paintings, frescoes and sculptures, Florence harbours the worldâs densest concentration of Renaissance art (and not only), remarkable for both the sheer volume of work contained within its walls, but also for the quality; expect to see masterpieces by the likes of Giotto, Masaccio, the Lippis, Leonardo and Michelangelo.
Exactly why this ârebirthâ occurred in Florence is a matter for debate, but wealthy patrons such as the ruling Medicis, along with the presence of outstanding artistic talents and the 15th-century thirst for knowledge, certainly helped.

Accademia Gallery, Florence
Florence, Tuscany, Italy
Bucket List Experience
Florenceâs other big-name art museum (with the Uffizi) has a world-class collection of 14th- and 15th-century art, but those endless queues of people are really here to see one thing: Michelangeloâs 1504 4m-high statue of David.
Moved here in 1873 from Piazza della Signoria, the iconic sculpture appears quite different in the flesh: the head and hands are larger than expected (a trick of perspective; originally the statue was placed higher up).
Walk around the back to see Davidâs sling, a tree stump â and those famous buttocks.

Florenceâs must-see Renaissance architecture
Florence, Tuscany, Italy
Bucket List Experience
Florence is known as the cradle of the Renaissance and is home to a wealth of buildings belonging to that era. Lavish Romanesque and Gothic styles were fashionable in the 11th â 13th centuries, before an early Renaissance style emerged in the early 15th century.
The centre of Florence is filled with palaces, churches and monuments defining this movement which was characterised by a classical sensibility with pilasters, columns, arches and pediments and strictly mathematical proportions.
The three architects who dominated the period were Brunelleschi, Michelozzo and Alberti while Michelangelo became one of the most important architects of the High Renaissance.

Completed in 1436, this multi-colored marble megalith is crowned with one of the marvels of the Renaissance world; Brunelleschiâs vast double-shelled dome â built without scaffolding â was a breathtaking feat of engineering.

Florenceâs art-filled churches and chapels
Florence, Tuscany, Italy
Bucket List Experience
Many of Florenceâs religious buildings were constructed between the 11th and 13th centuries, but few have remained untainted by later additions. During Renaissance times, wealthy families such as the ruling Medicis commissioned the finest artists to fresco family chapels, carve tombs for loved ones, update architectural structures and create bespoke works of art.
Step into any Florentine church today and youâll find an extraordinary legacy of art treasures by masters such as Giotto, Masaccio, the Lippis and Michelangelo.

Florenceâs best food & drink
Florence, Tuscany, Italy
Bucket List Experience
The Florentines are quite traditional in what they eat and justly proud of their local cuisine which is hearty, rustic, and based on simple ingredients such as bread, pulses, meat and poultry, fresh veg and olive oil, all prepared with the minimum of fuss. Typical seasonal ingredients include artichokes and porcini mushrooms, wild boar, rabbit, pork, game and excellent beef.
Wash it down with one of the robust local red wines; Tuscany is Italyâs premier wine-growing region producing from Chianti Classico in the hills between Florence and Siena to the highly-rated (and highly-priced) Super Tuscans from the Bolgheri zone on the coast.
Meals are traditionally divided into antipasti (starters), primi (soup, pasta), secondi (meat, fish) and dolce (dessert).

Experience
For centuries, the Oltrarno neighbourhood south of the river has been known for its artisan workshops, originally established to furnish and decorate the grand palazzi that were built in the area by local aristocrats.

Cape Town
Western Cape, South Africa
Destination guide
One of the most beautiful cities in the world, Cape Town is a melting pot of diverse cultures and ideologies with a fascinating past. While it attracts visitors year-round, the city is at its most seductive in summer when locals and tourists come out to play.
It offers dramatic landscapes, glorious beaches of golden sand, and a kaleidoscope of multicultural entertainment attracting everyone from outdoor adrenaline junkies to nightlife-loving party animals.
But where Cape Town truly excels is in its culinary adventures, with world-class restaurants and street markets to explore, alongside terroir-driven wines from the nearby Cape Winelands.

Abseil down Table Mountain
Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa

Table Mountain
Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa
Bucket List Experience
Cape Townâs iconic flat-topped mountain is 1,085m (3,559ft) above sea level at its highest point, Maclearâs Beacon. One of the ‘New 7 Wonders of Nature’, its name also derives from the thin layer of wind-blown cloud that forms over the flat summit before dropping dramatically over the edge like a tablecloth.
Itâs now part of the Table Mountain National Park, set up to protect the landmark but also the rare fynbos vegetation. The site is now a UNESCO Cape Floral Region World Heritage Site.
Ride up in the Table Mountain Aerial Cableway to enjoy spectacular 360-degree views of the city, and wander the fynbos-fringed footpaths that criss-cross the serene and beautiful flat-topped sum
If youâre reasonably fit, and a little adventurous,Â you canÂ hike up to the summit rather than take the cable car. There are a number of different trails that you can do independently or with a guide. You can also abseilÂ down fromÂ the summit.

Dive with great white sharks in Cape Town
Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa
Bucket List Experience
In the waters off Cape Town itâs the Great White Shark, carcharodon carcharias, that rules the roost, and admiring this remarkable predator in its natural environment â from the safety of a sturdy steel cage, of course ââ¯isÂ a bucket listÂ experienceÂ youâll never forget.
Spacious speedboats leave Kleinbaai harbour (two hoursâ drive from Cape Town) in the early morning, setting course for Dyer Island and the famous âShark Alleyâ. Here, chum (fish bait) is released into the water, the cage is lowered and adventurers don their wetsuits. When a shark comes to investigate, itâs into the water you go.
Note â you don’t have to go in the water to enjoy this trip. Watching these majestic, and curious, creatures glide around from the security of the boat is also worth going for.
Note from Matt: the great whites vanished from the area following the arrival of two orcas (that prey on the great whites) in 2000. They were spotted again at the start of 2024â¦ but check before you book to see if they are being seen on these tours. If there are no great whites, the tour operators will often take you to dive with other types of shark – still worth doing.

Stellenbosch Wine Region
Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa
Bucket List Experience
South Africaâs oldest wine route is home to more than 150 wineries, many of them still family owned, and the estates around Stellenbosch continue to produce wines that are internationally recognised for their excellent quality.

With gourmet restaurants,Â gorgeousÂ Cape Dutch architecture andÂ superbÂ art galleries, the route offers so much more than just wine tasting. And itâs not just for adults. Some of the wine estates have good facilities to keep the kids entertained, such as the outdoor playparks at Tokara and Warwick.

Hike up Table Mountain
Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa
Bucket List Experience
Towering more than 3,000-feet aboveÂ the city, Table Mountain defines theÂ skyline of Cape Town. And whileÂ going up byÂ cableÂ carÂ is an easy option for the unfit, hiking the mountain slopes is a far better way to appreciate the flora, fauna and fine views of this World Heritage Site.
There are dozens of routes on, up and around the mountain. The most popular, independently-tackled route is the well-marked Platteklip Gorge (a challenging 2- to 3-hour hike). If you want something more adventures â like the forested trails that lead up the eastern slopes above Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens â book a guided hike. Guides will teach about the local fynbosÂ and the Cape Floral KingdomÂ as you ascend.
The true summit is at Maclearâs Beacon, but keen hikers should allow time to discover the quieter trails that explore the âBack Tableâ to the south.
Good for age: 13+

Robben Island
Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa
Bucket List Experience
One of the most poignant destinations for any visitor to Cape Town, this UNESCO-listed World Heritage Site and museum is an infamous prison island in the middle of Table Bay. During apartheid it held some of SAâs most famous political prisoners, including former president Nelson Mandela.

Situated just 20 minutesâ drive from the city, itâs a convenient option for those lacking the time to visitÂ Stellenbosch and Franschhoek.Â The valleyâs ocean-facing location, cooled inÂ the summer by steady sea breezes, resultsÂ inÂ vibrantÂ white wines reminiscent of Bordeaux, alongside structured and elegant red wines. The valley is also increasingly becoming a culinary hotpot in the city.

Cape Town Township Tours
Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa
Bucket List Experience
Townships â undeveloped, sprawling communities of small houses and shacks â are a blight on what is otherwise a gorgeous city. Home to the ânon-whitesâ during apartheid area, they remain a symbol of division and inequality. Aside from a few new satellite dishes, for most residents, not a lot has changed in the post-Apartheid era. Most houses are still made from cobbled-together corrugated iron sheeting for ceilings and walls.
Townships areÂ integral toÂ the city landscape, and toÂ understanding Cape Townâs history, culture and post-apartheid challenges. No wonder then that so-called âTownship Toursâ have become so popular. They offer a fascinating insight into the realities of life on the socially-depressed Cape Flats.
Perhaps surprisingly, rather than being a depressing experience,Â they can be uplifting â especially when you witness theÂ ubuntu, meaning the spirit of togetherness, despite the hardships and challenges of daily life.Â There are many community projects on the go, with opportunities for sponsorship or a donation.
Locals are generally friendly, and you may even get invited into the local âpubâ to try some home-made beer.

Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa
Bucket List Experience

âChappiesâ, as itâs affectionately known, also sees cyclists, bikers and runners enjoying the sweeping, staggering coastal views: think giant boulders, seal colonies, pounding surf, dramatic cliffs and miles of endless blue stretching into the horizon.
For an extra specialÂ treat, book a night atÂ TintswaloÂ Atlantic, a romantic and alluring hideaway set in the ancient milkwood forest at the foot of Chapmanâs Peak. Remote but spectacular.
Good for age: 4+

Cape Point & the Cape Peninsular
Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa
Bucket List Experience
Treacherous seas, sandy coves and sheer cliffs characterise Cape Point, located at the tip of the Cape Peninsula, 60km southwest of Cape Town.
The 7,750-hectare Cape Point nature reserve, which falls within the Table Mountain National Park, makes a great day trip for nature lovers, with its fynbos (the smallest yet richest of the world’s six floral kingdoms), antelope, baboons, Cape Mountain zebras and Cape clawless otters. But note, contrary to popular belief, it’s not the place where the Atlantic and Indian oceans meet – that’s Cape Agulhas, 150Km to the east.
The drive there is lovely, and the penguin colony at Boulders Beach is conveniently on the way and often included as a stop on a Cape Peninsular tour. It’s a rare spot to see wild penguins in their natural habitat.
Be sure to climb up Cape Pointâs lighthouse, 286m above sea level, for spectacular ocean views. To reach the lighthouse, walk or take the âFlying Dutchmanâ â a funicular named after a ghostly ship that is said to sail around the point.

If you have the time, it’s a fantastic addition to any Cape Town itinerary – and one of the world’s great road trips. Plan on at least 6 nights, though you could easily spend two weeks here and not see it all.
Note – the name of the route has nothing to do with gardens; it takes its name from the Garden Route National Park that it passes through.

Cape Townâs best food & drink
Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa
Bucket List Experience
From tapas to sushi, coffee to wine, Cape Townâs international food, with an African twist, is sophisticated and superb.
Cape Town is perhaps best known for delicious Cape Malay cuisine â curries that are fragrantly spicy rather than fiery â a unique style of cuisine originating with the thousands of Malay slaves brought to Cape Town from Indonesia and Malaysia in the 17th and 18th centuries. See our recommendations below for tasting tours and Cape Malay cooking classes.
Being a port city, fresh seafood features prominently â expect plenty of fresh local line fish, crayfish and mussels â though meat is much-loved and excellent too. In summer look out for fresh yellowtail and rock lobster. Also, see our round-up of traditional foods you must try in South Africa.
Two world-class wine regions â Constantia and Stellenbosch â are on the city’s doorstep. Constantia is a 40-minute drive from the city centre, Stellenbosch around 1 to 1.5 hours, so both are very do-able on day trips.

From boutique wineries offering cellar tours and tastings, to charming bistros and fine dining in the heart of the village, it is a bucket list destination for bacchanalian adventures.
Alongside the feast of food and wine, thereâs culture to discover here too, from the townâs graceful Huguenot Monument to the many art galleries dotted along the main road and on surrounding estates.
If itâs joie de vivre in the Cape youâre after, head straight to Franschhoek. It’s barely an hour’s drive from Cape Town – very doable for a day trip – though foodies and oenophiles will undoubtedly want to stay longer.

Whale-watching at Hermanus [kayaking]
Hermanus, Western Cape, South Africa
Bucket List Experience
When the southern right whales make their annual migration from icy Antarctic waters to mate and calve in the temperate seas off South Africa, Hermanus is the place to be. With its steep cliffs and plentiful vantage points, this somewhat-trendy holiday town offers some of the most accessible land-based whale watching in the world.
A cliff-top trail meanders through town, offering up a number of easy-to-access viewpoints. The wonderful thing about whale season is the luck of the draw: pick your spot, take out your binoculars and scan the seas. If youâre lucky, the blubbery tourists will be breaching, lob-tailing and spy hopping off the cliffs, barely 100m away.
Alternatively, take a boat tour for close-up views. Boat-based whale-watching tours depart from the New Harbour. Theyâre not cheap, but youâre all but assured of incredible sightings.Â You can also kayak out to see them.Â Walker Bay Adventures will take you out intoÂ Walker Bay in sea kayaks.
Whales are there in season, but dolphins and seals are present all year round. If you time it for late September/early October, you’ll catch the Hermanus Whale Festival.Â TheÂ climaxÂ of the season is a celebration of cetaceans, complete with live music, kidsâ entertainment and a tempting range of food stalls.

Big Game Safaris (from Cape Town)
Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa
Bucket List Experience
Thereâs nothing quite like the thrill of a Big Game African safari. The sense of wild that has your senses on highest alert; the spine-tingling roar of a lion or menacing cackle of a hyena, the added spice of fear, terror even, from sleeping in the realm of big, man-eating cats. Itâs why a safari should be on everyoneâs bucket list.
Youâre not going to get that same raw Africa experience here. The private game reserves a few hoursâ drive from Cape Town are somewhere between a safari park and the real deal. Often the reserves are âstockedâ with animals.
But donât be discouraged, if you have time, itâs well worth tagging a few days onto your Cape Town itinerary to spend a few days in the bush. Youâll get to experience a safari in more comfort and safety, and see the Big Five on exciting game drives. Perfect for anyone who wants to do a safari, but doesnât fancy the full âOut of Africaâ experience, and for those of us who cannot get enough.
There are some great camps within driving distance – try Aquila, Sanbona and Inverdoorn. Children of all ages are usually welcome, though there will be age restrictions for kids to join game drives.

The gorgeous Atlantic side beaches in the trendy neighbourhoods of Clifton and Camps Bay are more of a âsceneâ and thrum with Capetonians.Â The beaches further out from the city are better for beach lazing and surfing.

Bo-Kaap
Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa
Experience
The vibrant suburb of Cape Town, formerly known as the Cape Malay Quarter, is famous for its colourful house facades and steep, cobblestone streets.
It’s one of the oldest neighbourhoods in Cape Town, and one of the few areas genuinely historical areas – and is now a declared National Monument. It was built at the end of the 18th century, initially attracting lower-income families and artisans, followed by an influx of former Malay slaves following the abolition of slavery in 1830.
Originally, all of the (rented) houses, known as huurhuisjes, had to be white. But when this rule was lifted and the slaves were permitted to purchase their houses, they apparently painted them bright colours to express their new-found freedom.
Walking tours are best for those wanting to delve deeper into the culture and history of this fascinating neighbourhood. Bo-Kaap offers a unique and rare window into Cape Town – and South Africa’s – past. The tiny Bo-Kaap Museum, set within one of the oldest and most well-preserved houses dating back to the 1760s, houses historical documents, photographs, artefacts, and interactive displays.

Iziko Slave Lodge
Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa
Experience
The slave trade in Cape Town, initiated by the Dutch East India Company in the 17th century, was the cornerstone of the city’s early economy. Slaves were shipped here from Malay (Indonesia and Malaysia), Madagascar and India, to work on farms and in households for the colonising British. Mercifully, this heinous trade was abolished in 1834, but its legacy endures. The immigrants have profoundly affected almost every aspect of the city’s culture and societal dynamics – food, music, and more.
This museum is dedicated to preserving this dark yet transformative period of the city’s history, bringing it to life through the stories of real slaves. Open Monday to Saturday.

Havana
Cuba
Destination guide
Sensual and sultry Havana is the coolest city in the Caribbean. Her salty Spanish colonial streets fizz with music, her art shines a light on revolutions, and her architecture – a handsome jumble of Spanish villas, churches, art deco towers, and baroque mansions line promenades, tight historic streets, and her famous winding ocean-facing road, the MalecÃ³n.
Go for the live music, dance, art, the new bars and restaurants, and the Cuban wit, and to witness the last bastion of communism in the western hemisphere. Havana is enigmatic, energetic, maddening, and safe, and is perfect for couples, families and history-curious folk.

Cigar factory tours
Havana, Cuba
Bucket List Experience
Winston Churchill puffed on Romeo y Julieta, Che Guevara on Montecristo, and Fidel Castroâs favourite smoke was a Cohiba.
Cuban cigars are famous around the world. Thereâs a reason: itâs the combination of a perfect blend of tobacco plant terroir in southwestern Cuba, the climate, and the 200 artisanal processes that crafts a cigar from its tiny beginnings as a pinhead-sized tobacco seed to luxury smoke.

Art in Havana
Havana, Cuba
Bucket List Experience
In the last 10 years, Cubaâs art scene has exploded across Havana, with state-run galleries and private artÂ spaces emergingÂ to showcase exciting and challenging contemporary art.Â NewÂ photography galleries have also opened their doors in a city buzzing with creativity.
The place to go for Cuba’s best art is the Cuban section of Havanaâs Museum of Fine Arts, which exhibits a rich body of work, spanning more than 400 years of works. Cubaâs most famous artist, Wilfredo Lam, working mid-century and considered a Cuban Picasso, has sold works for vast sums at auction. Tomas Sanchezâs dreamlike landscape paintings are mesmerising, and fetch high prices.
Cuba doesnât have a domestic art market as such, so artists rely on international tourism and in particular the popular Havana Biennial (Bienal de la Habana) art fair.

Dine at a paladar
Havana, Cuba
Bucket List Experience
The best way to experience Cuban cuisine, international dishes, and hospitality is to eat at a paladar â a private restaurant run by Cuban entrepreneurs. Hundreds of such private restaurants (paladares) have opened in the last 2 decades years across Havana.
Initially restricted to mom-and-pop outfits â in private homes and limited to only 12 chairs, a recent relaxation of the rules has seen these small-scale restaurants expand to fill entire homes (e.g. Otra Manera) or open in dedicated venues.
On the menu youâll now find simple and elaborate seafood dishes, ropa vieja (shredded beef or pork and veg in a tomato-based sauce), roasted suckling pig, Cuba-made goatsâ cheese, chicken Kiev (in the one Russian paladar) and Chinese dumplings (made by a Tianjin chef).

Castle of Los Tres Reyes del Morro
Havana, Cuba
Bucket List Experience
In the decades spanning the 16th and 18th centuries, Cubaâs Spanish rulers built a series of imposing forts to repel rampaging buccaneers from raiding the Spanish treasure fleets in the Bay of Havana, and to fence out the English. Five hundred years on, these muscular fortresses still dominate Havanaâs harbour, and have come to symbolise the city â they even appear on the cityâs coat of arms.
El Morro Castle, and its lighthouse, is the most iconic and the cityâs emblem. This impressive stone and coral fort, complete with cannons, defended the eastern headland of Havana Bay from pirate attacks until the end of the 18th century, when the British captured the city.
The fortress houses a display on the Italian engineers and builders of the castle. You can also climb the 19th-century lighthouse for a view of the city and MalecÃ³n.

Another option to consider is booking your scenic flight upon arrival as your airport transfer â as well as instantly ticking off one bucket list experience, seeing the city and coastline from above is a great way to get your bearings.

Bondi to Coogee Walk
Sydney, New South Wales, Australia
Bucket List Experience
This stunning 6km coastal walk along the picturesque clifftops between Bondi and Coogee beaches is one of Sydneyâs signature experiences, popular with visitors and locals alike.
The clifftop path takes from Bondi Beach, alongside craggy cliffs filled with wild vegetation, past the lovely Tamarama, Bronte and Clovelly beaches. There are rockpools, headlands, bays, parks and even a rather scenic cemetery.
You can stop half-way at the pleasant clutch of cafÃ©s at Bronte Beach for a burger or a fresh juice (and turn back again for a shorter walk). Take your swimming togs and have a dip along the way.

Sydney Museum of Contemporary Art
Sydney, New South Wales, Australia
Experience
Launched in 1991 as a young upstart rival to the Art Gallery of NSW (AGNSW) across town, the MCA now plays a major role in the cultural life of Sydney.
As its title suggests, the focus of this waterfront gallery is contemporary art from Australia and abroad. Its own collection of 4,000 works spans all art forms, including painting, photography, sculpture and the moving image.
Its permanent collection consists of works by contemporary Australian artists, including leading indigenous painters. But the Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA) also prides itself on making modern art accessible to those who generally donât visit galleries by featuring the work of artists such as Christo, Jeff Koons and Roy Lichtenstein.
The MCA also hosts a large number of temporary exhibitions during the year.

Kayaking on Sydney Harbour
Sydney, New South Wales, Australia
Bucket List Experience
Recognised as one of the worldâs most beautiful waterways, Sydney Harbour offers plenty of hidden coves, islands and secret beaches to visit â perfect for kayaking. Itâs also a great way to get out and appreciate Circular Quay and the major landmarks from a different perspective â the Opera House, for one, looks very different from the water side.
Guided tours leave from several locations, but Rose Bay and Balmoral Beach are particularly scenic, with sandy beaches, flash waterfront property and plenty of luxury boats. If you want to see some of the cityâs famous landmarks, then book a small group tour from the Domain.

Surf lessons on Bondi Beach
Sydney, New South Wales, Australia
Bucket List Experience
Australia has been obsessed with surfing since 1915 when Hawaiian legend Duke Kahanamoku toured the country. Since then, Bondi Beach, Sydneyâs most accessible beach, has been synonymous with board riding of every kind â from longboarding to boogie boarding.
Bondi Beach is considered one of the best beaches for novice surfers because it offers consistently good surf â although the southern end of the beach, with its powerful right-handers, is generally reserved for more experienced riders. Many Sydneysiders have learned to surf here and Letâs Go Surfing, the resident surf academy, has been operating at North Bondi since 1995.

Manly Beach
Sydney, New South Wales, Australia
Experience
Manly Beach is perhaps second only to Bondi in terms of global fame, but since it lies on the North Shore of Sydney Harbour has its own unique charms â and unlike Bondi there is plenty of street parking. Flanked by Norfolk pine trees, this 1.5km-long strip of golden sand is family-friendly, suitable for surfers and swimmers.

Seaplane to Palm Beach
Sydney, New South Wales, Australia
Experience
Soaring high above the sparkling waters of Sydney Harbour in a seaplane is surely one of the worldâs top travel experiences â whether youâre skimming the waves in Rose Bay, banking over the Opera House or thundering over the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Taking off and landing on water is an experience in itself.
Those with limited time can choose a 15-minute scenic flight over the harbour, Manly and Bondi. Others might opt for a charter flight up the coast to Pittwater, the Hawkesbury River or even the Central Coast.
If you have time, a day trip to Palm Beach, one of Sydneyâs ânorthern beachesâ and a playground of the super-rich, is arguably the pick of the trips. The day trip includes lunch at a local restaurant, kayaking and a stroll along the famous white sands.

Sydney, New South Wales, Australia

Itâs noisy, crowded and usually smelly, but the Fish Market is a much-loved part of the Sydney culinary scene. The site is home to a retail and wholesale fish market, plus a small working port and excellent seafood cooking school.
Drop in for a plate of sushi, some fresh oysters or piping hot fish n chips. Itâs worth the trip just to wander around the kaleidoscopic displays of shellfish, giant tuna and lobsters. These are the dying days of the market â a brand spanking new facility is under construction across the water in Blackwattle Bay; due to open in 2023.

Blue Mountains [hiking, canyoning, & mountain biking]
Blue Mountains National Park, New South Wales, Australia
Experience
Sydneyâs infatuation with the ocean means that the Blue Mountains do not get the attention they deserve. Just 50kms from the city, the Blue Mountains National Park comprises 260,000 hectares of native forest, cascading waterfalls and towering sandstone escarpments. The blue tinge you see is a result of eucalyptus oil in the air.
While day trippers are content to view the landscape from a car park, you should really try to experience its rugged beauty firsthand. Guided rock climbing, canyoning or mountain biking are all excellent. Or just pull on a pair of good boots and tackle one of the many accessible hiking trails into the national park â anything from 1 hour to multi-day hikes.

Victoria Falls
Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe
Destination guide
Long before David Livingstone named them for his Queen, the locals living on either side of the Zambezi River called the Victoria Falls ‘Mosi-oa-Tunya’; âthe smoke that thundersâ. And rightly so, for visiting in late summer â with the Falls in full spate â is a deafening, soaking and humbling experience. Stretching for almost a mile across the Zambezi River, the falls plummet more than 100m into the Bakota Gorge â twice the height of Niagara Falls.
While the Falls are downright impressive,Â  itâs the areaâs array of activities â from Big Five game drives and white-water rafting, to helicopter flips and bungee jumping â that has turned the area encompassing Livingstone (Zambia) and Victoria Falls town (Zimbabwe) into Africaâs adventure playground.

White-water rafting on the Zambezi River
Zimbabwe
Bucket List Experience
Widely regarded as some of the best white-water rafting in the world, running the rapids formed by the Zambezi funnelling through the Batoka Gorge, is far and away the most popular adventure activity at Victoria Falls.
These are among the largest commercially rafted rapids in the world, and not for the faint-hearted. However, rafting companies take safety incredibly seriously and guides are trained in swift-water rescue and accredited by the International Rafting Federation.
Adult price: Â£100
Min age 15

Victoria Falls Waterfall
Zimbabwe
Bucket List Experience
Straddling the border of Zambia & Zimbabwe, Victoria Falls is the worldâs largest sheet of falling water â an incredible spectacle that sees the entire 1.7km span of the great Zambezi River tumble off a vertical ridge, sending clouds of mist into the surrounding forest.
First âdiscoveredâ by David Livingstone in 1855, Victoria Falls â at a whopping 108m high â it is one of the largest waterfalls on the planet.
From the raw power of summer floods to the delicate cataracts of the dry season, itâs impossible not to be awed and humbled byÂ Mosi-Oa-Tunya, the âsmoke that thundersâ.
Good for age: 4+

Swim in the Devilâs Pool
Livingstone, Southern Province, Zambia
Bucket List Experience
Livingstone Island, a small island in the centre of the flow, was opened in 1995 to offer a unique, and truly mind-blowing picnic spot â right on the edge of the Falls.
Yet increasingly the real draw for many to the island has become the Devilâs Pool, a small lagoon, enclosed by rock, right on the lip of the 103m-high Falls, where a lucky (crazy) few, at the right time of year, can go for a dip. The pool is chest-deep and calm, so you donât need to be a strong swimmer, but youâll want a good head for heights.

Kayak the Zambezi River
Zimbabwe
Bucket List Experience
If rafting the Grade V white-water rapids of the Batoka Gorge are too intimidating, a sedate canoe safari on the Zambezi River above the Falls is a good fallback option.
Using stable inflatable canoes, youâll paddle through a selection of small rapids, viewing both the Zambian and Zimbabwean side of the river. Big game sightings â including hippo, elephant and crocodile â are commonplace, ensuring your fair share of adrenalin.

Bungee jump from Victoria Falls Bridge
Zimbabwe
Bucket List Experience
A J Hackett invented the craze of jumping off bridges attached to a stretchable âbungeeâ at Kawarau Bridge, New Zealand. Today, bungee jumping is fairly ubiquitous, but itâs the setting that makes it an extra special bucket list experience.
It may not be the highest or the oldest, but Victoria Fallsâ 111m historic railway bridge spans a spectacular gorge over the churning, crocodile-infested Zambezi. Jump to the thunderous soundtrack of the mega-waterfall behind. Itâs unquestionably one of the worldâs greatest bunjee jumps â if not the greatest?

Zip-line across the Zambezi River
Victoria Falls Town, Matabeleland North, Central African Republic (CAR)
Bucket List Experience
If you canât face the prospect of bungee jumping from the famous Victoria Falls Bridge, the adrenalin-pumping zip-line is a fine way to get your thrills above the Batoka Gorge. The zip-line stretches for 425 metres across the gorge, and stepping free of terra firma will see you hurtling along at more than 100km/h.
If you have the presence of mind, look upstream and youâll be rewarded with dramatic views of the Falls and the iconic iron railway bridge. Afterwards, catch your breath with a drink at the scenic Lookout CafÃ©.

Safaris around Victoria Falls
Zimbabwe
Bucket List Experience
While the waterfall is the main attraction, the game reserves around Victoria Falls offer some decent sightings, and are a bucket list inclusion if you have not yet been on safari.
You might not see the âBig Fiveâ (elephant, rhino, buffalo, lion and leopard) but to experience the African bush â in vehicles or on foot â is unforgettable and unmissable. The best reserves for sightings are Victoria Falls Private Game Reserve, and Zambiaâs Mosi-Oa-Tunya National Park â home to the protected white rhino.
Make sure you book a night drive. They cost more, but are tremendously exciting (especially for kids) and offer the chance to spot lesser-seen nocturnals like porcupines and aardvarks.

Helicopter flights over Victoria Falls
Livingstone, Southern Province, South Africa
Bucket List Experience
David Livingstone wrote of the Victoria Falls that âscenes so lovely must have been gazed upon by angels in flightââ¦ so perhaps itâs no surprise that flying over the falls is one of the best way to appreciate the great spectacle.
Short flips have you over the Falls and back in under 15 minutes, while longer chopper excursions drop into the gorge to skim above the rapids. Choose between helicopters, or, for the truly daring, microlights.
Adult price: Â£150
Good for age: 10+

Cruise on the Zambezi
Victoria Falls Town, Matabeleland North, Zimbabwe
Bucket List Experience
While most of your Victoria Falls trip will be spent on adventure and adrenalin, a cruise on the upper Zambezi is all about relaxing with a few drinks.
Cruises take place throughout the day, but the sundowner trip is hard to beat: while the sun burnishes the waters of the Zambezi, keep an eye open for elephant swimming between the banks, and an ear alert for the ‘ho-ho-ho’ of a grumpy hippo.
Adult price: Â£35

Jetboating on the Zambezi
Livingstone, Southern Province, Zambia
Bucket List Experience
Why go down the surging Zambezi when you can go up? Where the white-water rafting ends is where the Jet Boat Extreme begins, powering up the rapids courtesy of a 700-horsepower engine that makes short work of the raging river.
Itâll shake your fillings loose and leave you soaked, but this white-knuckle ride is ideal for visitors who canât Â­â or wonât â brave the rapids by raft.

Cecil John Rhodes dreamt of a railway from Cape to Cairo, crossing Victoria Fallsâ famous bridge. His tracks never made it that far, but you can still relive the glamour of colonial train travel as this historic steam train runs through the Zambian bush.
Carriages are decorated in a plush colonial style, and as the locomotive chuffs through the game-rich Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park and across the Sinde River, youâll have the chance to spot antelope on the hoof. After toasting the sunset on the iconic Victoria Falls bridge, a five-course set-menu dinner is served.

Safari in Chobe National Park
Chobe National Park, Okavango Delta, Central African Republic (CAR)
Bucket List Experience
One of Africaâs most spectacular wilderness areas, Botswanaâs Chobe National Park is an easy day-trip from Victoria Falls. Guided tours include a game drive in the Park, but the highlight is a game-spotting cruise on the Chobe River, with its profusion of hippo, crocodile and birdlife.
Chobe is famed for its thousands of elephantsÂ â so if you want to get up close to wild herds of elephant, this is the place to visit â as well as the prides of elephant-hunting lions that prey on them. (The kills invariably happen though at night, so youâre unlikely to see one).
The Park is home to more than 400 species of bird, making it one the top birding spots in Africa, as well as the only place in Botswana where you can spot the threatened Puku antelope.

Fishing for tiger fish

The tiger fish is regarded as the finest freshwater fighting fish in the world, and the Zambezi is arguably the best place to catch them.
Daily fishing safaris set off into the calm waters above the Falls (or amid the rapids of the Batoka Gorge), and expert local guides induct you into the wily ways of hooking this fearsome predator. Even if youâre not a fisherperson, itâs a pleasure being out on the water.

Bangkok
Central Thailand, Thailand
Destination guide
Bangkok is one of South East Asiaâs most complex and contradictory cities. Gritty but glamorous, lively but laid-back, the Thai capital is a hive of frenetic street activity with traffic gridlock that grinds the place to a halt for hours.
Itâs home to the regionâs best fine dining restaurants, as well as tasty street food stalls, sleazy girlie bars and sleek cocktail spots. Itâs the address for retro hipster markets and posh designer stores, lofty luxury hotels and charming B&Bs.
Perhaps surprisingly, itâs also a tranquil haven dotted with tropical gardens and glinting temples.
Whatever your penchant, Bangkokâs almost certainly got it covered.

Grand Palace
Bangkok, Central Thailand, Thailand
Bucket List Experience
The former seat of power of Siamese kings, the glittering Grand Palace complex is one of Thailandâs big tourism draw cards.
Constructed in 1782, the complex includes halls, pavilions and temples set around open lawns, gardens and courtyards â it was the home of Thai kings for 150 years and is still considered their spiritual and ceremonial base. While the King no longer lives here, itâs still used for ceremonies.
Decorated in shimmering mosaics and vivid murals, the buildings are incredible, especially the temple of Wat Phra Kaew.

Bangkokâs Temples & Shrines
Bangkok, Central Thailand, Thailand
Bucket List Experience
With their golden roofs and incense-swirled spires, Bangkokâs 400-or-so wats (temples) arenât just a pretty backdrop for box-ticking tourists, but a cornerstone of Thai society. Thais from all walks of life come here to make merit and ask Buddhist deities for good for-tune at work or in their relationships, while many young men stay as temporary monks as a rite of passage towards adulthood.
The cityâs oldest temples, such as the 16th century Wat Pho, bedazzle with their jewel-studded opulence, but more recent builds, such as Wat Samphran with a giant dragon coiling around its tower, are equally impressive.
Good for age: 13+

Ayutthaya Historical Park
Bangkok, Central Thailand, Thailand
Bucket List Experience
Before Bangkok â or Krung Thep â became Thailandâs (then Siam) capital in 1782, Ayutthaya was the Kingdomâs centre of power. As one of the world’s most cosmopolitan cities of that time, it drew in merchants from all corners of the globe and grew into a vast empire of grand palaces and gilded temples. That abruptly ended when the Burmese ransacked the city in 1767 and reduced its splendours to rubble.
Today, it stands as a ruined shell of its former past, littered with bricks, dilapidated shrines and crumbling Buddha statues consumed by nature. But wander around these ruins, and youâll only need a pinch of imagination to envision just how splendid this city once was.

Now a museum, the site is in fine condition, with much of Thompsonâs extensive art and antiques collection on display throughout, making it one of Bangkok’s must-do attractions.
Make sure you stop by the shop â there are plenty of pretty things on offer, from Jim Thompson silk to beautiful handmade souvenirs.

Bangkokâs best food & drink
Bangkok, Central Thailand, Thailand
Bucket List Experience
As the epicentre of one of the worldâs most beloved cuisines, Bangkok is an excellent grazing ground for Thai food from every corner of the country. Thereâs creamy massaman curry and tom kha kai (chicken coconut soup), of course, which you can find everywhere from dingy street food carts to Michelin-rated restaurants.
But Bangkok is also an excellent place to hunt down hyper-local dishes you wonât find on the menu of your hometown Thai joint.
Seek out southern Thai cuisine for its ferociously fiery curries and ample use of fresh seafood. Opt for eastern fare, where shrimp paste and regional herbs create umami-rich and earthy flavours. Or follow your nose to kitchens dishing up northern Thai classics such as khao soi curry soup and nam prik chilli dips.

Boat tours of Bangkok
Bangkok, Central Thailand, Thailand
Bucket List Experience
A trip down the Chao Phraya River or Bangkokâs many khlongs (canals) is the best way to get under the cityâs skin. Seen from the water, a wholly different Bangkok reveals itself: kids dive-bombing from rickety bridges, elderly ladies doing laundry, and croc-sized monitor lizards lazing in the sun.
One of the most enjoyable (and cheapest) boat rides is the public San Saeb Express, which connects the gleaming city centre to Bangkokâs historical heart, passing by stilted shanties and glittering temples along the way.
On the other end of the spectrum are the snazzy dinner cruise lines, such as Suppaniga Cruise, which combine fabulous Thai food with spectacular sunset views of Rattanakosin’s riverside temples.

More than 100.000 prisoners of war and civilian laborers lost their lives due to hunger and exhaustion, making this one of the deadliest construction projects in modern history.
These days, most visitors come to pay their respects at the iron railway bridge made famous by the eponymous 1957 movie Bridge on the River Kwai (though few know it was filmed in Sri Lanka).
But unless youâre a history buff, the bridge itself isnât all that interesting. Instead, board one of the rickety trains still cruising the tracks several times a day to get a much better feel of the intense suffering this project has caused.

Bangkokâs best shopping
Bangkok, Central Thailand, Thailand
Bucket List Experience
With its gleaming mega-malls and ramshackle riverside markets, Bangkok makes it dangerously easy to part with a whole lot of baht.
World-class shopping malls like CentralWorld and ICONSIAM house boutiques from almost every brand under the sun, while young Thai designers hawk indie fashion labels and funky home goods from stamp-sized boutiques around Pratunam and Siam Square.
And when these clock out, a slew of night markets pop up as neon-lit treasure troves with handicrafts and vintage clothes to paw through until well after midnight.

Thai kick boxing at Rajadamnern Boxing Stadium
Bangkok, Central Thailand, Thailand
Bucket List Experience
There are few better ways to witness Thailandâs from its wild side than at a Thai kickboxing (or Muay Thai) match. There will be sweat, there will be blood, and the crowd will be positively bonkers. But even if you canât tell a push kick from a round kick, the whooping and hollering around the ring is wildly contagious.
This national sport finds it origins in the battlefields of ancient Siam, but has since grown into a testosterone- and beer-soaked gambling night for the mainly male fraternity. Evenings usually consist of 9 fights, each of which is made up of five three-minute rounds. Headlining fights take place later in the night, and are usually reserved for the 7th, 8th, and 9th match.
The out-of-the-way New Lumpinee Boxing Stadium is the sanctum sanctorum of this national sport and welcomes the biggest stars, but the mid-century Rjadamnern Boxing Stadium near Rattanakosin is a much more accessible and an equally enthralling venue.

Bicycle tours of Chinatown
Bangkok, Central Thailand, Thailand
Bucket List Experience
A bike ride might not be the first thing that comes to mind when you first step foot into Bangkokâs cacophonous Chinatown. But venture away from the rip-roaring tuk-tuks and jam-packed side streets, and youâll soon discover that this colourful district perfectly lends itself for exploration on two wheels.
During guided tours, youâll pedal past incense-swirled spirit houses and hidden wet markets in Chinatownâs back alleys, then continue via longtail boat to palm groves and stilted villages in the cityâs rural suburbs.
Small groups and frequent informative stops make for a fascinating peek into the daily lives of the cityâs residents, and to discover the Big Mango from an unexpected angle.

Bangkokâs breathtaking sky bars
Bangkok, Central Thailand, Thailand
Bucket List Experience
Few cities in the world have a skyline as impressive as Bangkokâs, and in recent years a rooftop drinking scene has developed that offers the best and widest choice in all of South-East Asia. Sipping a cocktail at one of these head-spinningly high bars gives the chance to fully grasp just how massive this vibrant metropolis is.
Dress up and prepare to pose â these high-rise haunts are all about glamour, often with prices to match. But there are plenty of budget-friendly rooftop joints hidden in this concrete jungle too.

This is the worldâs largest weekend market, and even the most determined pathfinders are bound to get lost in its labyrinth of clothing shops, massage joints, souvenir stalls and coffee corners.

Koh Kret
Bangkok, Central Thailand, Thailand
Experience
Located in a horseshoe bend of the Chao Phraya River some 45 minutes north of Bangkok proper, palm-studded Koh Kret offers a welcome antidote to the city’s concrete jungle.
The island was created in 1722 by digging a canal to separate it from the mainland, and was once home to the Mon Hill Tribe, who emigrated here after the fall of Ayutthaya in 1765. Life here continues pretty much as it has done for centuries, with nothing more touristic than a handful of souvenir stores selling the communityâs signature pottery.
These days, their descendants inhabit a lively little village near the pier, with wooden footbridges and cycle paths linking the shacks, tumbledown houses and historic temples. If you want a glimpse of authentic Thai village life, this is the place to come.

Wat Samphran
Nakhom Pathom, Central Thailand, Thailand
Experience
Shaped like a giant dragon coiled around a concrete skyscraper, off-the-beaten-track Wat Samphran proves that not every temple is a riot of glitter and gold. A steep pathway through the dragonâs belly leads to the rooftop shrine with spectacular views over the countryside some 40km from Bangkok. It’s an extraordinary creation â and worth making the effort to go see it for yourself.

Floating Markets

Flaming woks balancing on tiny canoes, mountains of fresh fruits â Bangkokâs floating markets are a kaleidoscope of Thai-tinged wonder.

Bangkokâs Creative District
Bangkok, Thailand
Experience
Over the past few years, forward-thinking creatives have transformed Bangkokâs riverside Bang Rak area into the cityâs de-facto design district.
Here, boutique concept stores and art galleries blow new life into dilapidated shophouses, while wall-spanning street art by some of Thailandâs top artists infuses the winding alleys with a much-needed pop of colour.
Most galleries congregate around the Thailand Creative & Design Center in the Grand Postal Office, the creative hub that kick-started the artistic renaissance back in 2017, but new ones pop up almost monthly.
Highlights include Warehouse 30, a multi-use creative space in a WWII-era industrial complex; artsy concept store-meets-tea parlour Citizen Tea Canteen; and ATT19, a contemporary art gallery taking over a 120-year-old former school building.

Songkran

Tucked away in an unassuming street snaking off Ratanakosin, the little-visited Nang Loeng Market feels frozen in time. Itâs a street food hotspot, especially in the early mornings â donât miss the crispy roasted pork at Jib Ki and the traditional Thai desserts at Nanta.

Rio de Janeiro
Southeastern Region, Brazil
Destination guide
No city has a setting more beautiful than Rio, nor a population more devoted to the enjoyment of life. Locals (cariocas) call Rio simply âA Cidade Maravilhosaâ (The Marvellous City), and are too transfixed by its beauty â and their own â to do anything other than enjoy themselves, staying up late to party and rising early in the golden morning light to swim or surf in the cool ocean. Itâs the ultimate destination for healthy hedonists â hang glide, surf or hike by day and party all night.
Beyond the beach, though, there is culture here too if you know where to look â some great art and architecture, some interesting museums and the notorious favelas; for nature lovers, the city is surrounded by hummingbird-filled rainforest.
The biggest draw of all though is, of course, Rio’s world-famous Carnival â like a pilgrimage to Mecca, everyone should see it at least once.

Rio Carnival
Rio de Janeiro , Southeastern Region, Brazil
Bucket List Experience
Every year on the weekend before Shrove Tuesday, Rio throws the worldâs boldest and brashest party â Carnaval. There are events throughout the city, from huge bloco samba-swinging street parties (including in Ipanema, Copacabana, the City Centre and Santa Teresa), to balls in the Copacabana Palace.
The main spectacle is undoubtedly the famous samba schoolsâ parade which takes place in the SambÃ³dromo â a purpose-built arena in the city centre. This all-night kaleidoscope of gargantuan floats, sequinned samba dancers, drummers and scantily clad carnival queens, leaves the senses reeling. Unmissable.

Statue of Christ the Redeemer
Rio de Janeiro , Southeastern Region, Brazil
Bucket List Experience
Perched over Rio, on a high peak swathed with rainforest and illuminated in brilliant-white at night, this art deco beauty is a global icon every bit as good in real life as it looks in the pictures.
And the views of the city from the statueâs feet are as breathtaking as the Christ itself â the heart-shaped lagoon, Ipanema Beach and the distant bulk of the Sugar Loaf sitting over the shimmering bay.
There are many ways to see it â private car, taxi or organized tour â but the best way is probably via the funicular train, on a ride up through rainforest filled with floating butterflies, in the early morning when the light is golden. If budget allows, take a helicopter from Corcovado or Sugarloaf and go face-to-face with this spectacular statue, rather than staring up from its feet.

Rock climbing and abseiling on Sugarloaf Mountain
Rio de Janeiro, Southeastern Region, Brazil
Bucket List Experience
Guanabara Bay shimmering at your feet, Christ the Redeemer hovering on the horizon, rainforest, bays and beaches all around: few urban locations in the world offer a more spectacular backdrop to a rock climb or an abseil.
While it looks like a single mountain, the Sugarloaf you see in the photographs is actually two â the lower Morro da Urca (Urca hill) and the higher Pao de Acucar (Sugarloaf itself). There are climbing routes up both, ranging from the beginner level Morro da Urca Overview (a popular training route) to the technical, advanced Via dos Italianos route. Views are spectacular on all climbs.
Rio has some excellent climbing clubs and schools with fully accredited climbers and state-of-the-art equipment.

Rioâs most famous mountain crouches like a sphinx over a perfect half-moon bay just close to Copacabana. Itâs a stunning sight â its haunches carpeted with forest, its slopes reflected in the calm water.
The views from the top are even more breathtaking; especially in the late afternoon when the sun shines buttery-yellow on the sands of Copacabana, before dropping behind the Christ statue; and the lights of Rio twinkle on like stars.

Helicopter flights over Rio de Janeiro
Rio de Janeiro , Southeastern Region, Brazil
Bucket List Experience
Rio is a city of beautiful views â and the best views of all are from a helicopter as it floats over the cityâs boulder-like mountains, beach-fringed bays and sweeping Atlantic Ocean strands.
All flights fly right up to and face-to-face with the magnificent Christ the Redeemer statue, and drift over the dense rainforest that shrouds Tijuca National Park.
The views â of the city, sparkling bays with golden curves of beach, and hills covered with think rainforest or sprawling favela â are so breathtaking that youâll be back on land before you remember you have vertigo, and the adrenaline buzz will be with you for the rest of the day.

Tour a favela
Rio de Janeiro , Southwestern Region, Brazil
Bucket List Experience
Samba, Brazilian football, Rio funk and carnival were all born in Rioâs vibrant favelas. These marginalised, poor slums are as much a part of Rio â and the Rio experience â as the beaches or nightlife, and tours now take you inside â not only to see what life is like for residents, but to lay bare one of the most artistically vibrant and alternative communities in Latin America.
Itâs an edgy, culturally intriguing and slightly nerve-racking experience â but one that shows how much Rio is indebted to these tightly-knit communities.

Tijuca National Park
Rio de Janeiro , Southeastern Region, Brazil
Bucket List Experience
Most of central Rioâs boulder-mountains are protected as a vast sweep of wild tropical forest – cut by mountain streams and waterfalls and busy with toucans and monkeys as small as a kitten.
With fabulous views of the Christ the Redeemer statue and Rioâs beaches at every turn, Tijuca is a wonderful place for a steep cycle ride or hike with a view. Jungle trails run to a series of spectacular peaks â including Gavea Rock (Pedra Gavea, the worldâs largest monolith), Bonita Rock (Pedra Bonita, where thereâs hang gliding) and Tijuca Peak (Pico da Tijuca), the highest peak in Rio.
The path up GÃ¡vea involves an exposed rope-assisted scramble that hovers over a sheer precipice. Itâs not for the faint-hearted but the views are incredible. The path to Pedra Bonita is steep but short and easier â taking around 40 minutes, with stunning views over southern Rio. Active types should not miss the exceptional 3-hour hike to Tijuca Peak.

Rioâs best beaches
Rio de Janeiro , Southeastern Region, Brazil
Bucket List Experience
Life in Rio revolves around its long, golden beaches, where cariocas meet to relax, play and socialise. No visit to Rio would be complete without experiencing at least one. Beaches facing Guanabara Bay, including Botafogo and Flamengo, are pretty but water quality is poor. Atlantic-facing beaches, including Copacabana and Ipanema, are larger and cleaner. Beaches in the outer suburbs â like Grumari and Prainha â have the highest water quality and the best surf.
Join Rio locals for an early-morning workout. Joggers run along the sand, gym bunnies pump iron al fresco and everyone gathers at kiosks for a pre-work acai or coconut juice.

Copacabana Beach
Rio de Janeiro, Southeastern Region, Brazil
Bucket List Experience
This world-famous 4km crescent is the epicentre of Rioâs beach scene and the perfect place for beach sports and people-watching. It;’s not great for swimming â water quality is especially poor when the tide comes in.

Samba dancing in Lapa
Rio de Janeiro , Southeastern Region, Brazil
Bucket List Experience
Rio is the city of Samba youâll hear the music everywhere, in all its diverse forms. Like jazz, samba takes many forms â from the visceral, multi-drum beat which powers Carnival to the gentle sway youâll hear in intimate clubs and restaurants throughout Rio.
The best place to sample it is Lapa, on a weekend night. The neighbourhood is crammed with arty little boho clubs – set in converted costume warehouses, historic Belle Epoque mansions and tiny hole-in-the-wall bars. Cariocas and foreigners gather here – to swing together on the dance floor and congregate outside on the cobbled streets, fuelling the fun with icy caipirinha cocktails and draught chope beer.

The sport is long-established here, and a number of operators offer tandem or solo flights, which take off from the paragliding station atop the giant 520m-high monolith of Bonita Rock (Pedra Bonita).

Rioâs Botanical Gardens are a delight – with leafy trails running through semi-wild gardens to lily ponds, tinkling waterfalls and spectacular views of the Christ statue and Corcovado mountain at every turn. They preserve one of the best collections of neotropical plants in the world, and are a haven for wildlife â with 140 recorded species of birds â including 20 species of hummingbird.
Founded as the private retreat of the Brazilian emperor in the 19th century, and now listed by UNESCO as a biosphere reserve, the gardens are a great break from the heat and the beach â with shady glades and al fresco cafes.

Rio de Janeiroâs must-see architecture
Rio de Janeiro , Southeastern Region, Brazil
Bucket List Experience
On first glance Rioâs architecture is uninspiring. But this is the nationâs former capital and the birthplace of starchitect Oscar Niemeyer â and there are some real gems hidden away in the sea of concrete towers â which is why Rio was the first city to be nominated a World City of Architecture by UNESCO in 2020.
The city centre has some of the finest baroque buildings in South America (including gold-glittering Sao Bento monastery and Sao Francisco church), and a new museum district with Santiago Calatravaâs spaceship-like Museu do Amanha at its centre. In Niteroi across the bay, Niemeyerâs stunning Contemporary Art Museum hovers over the water. A city centre walk and tram ride is the best way to take in the highlights, followed by a ferry hop across the water to Niteroi.

Samba & Rioâs African Heritage at Valongo Wharf
Rio de Janeiro , Southeastern Region, Brazil

In 2017 Rio de Janeiro was awarded its second World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Valongo Wharf (Cais do Valongo) is the former stone dock where, from 1811 onwards, an estimated 900,000 enslaved Africans arrived in South America â part of the greatest number transported to the Americas.
The archaeological site lies at the heart of a burgeoning area devoted to African-Brazilian heritage which includes new museums, cultural centres and the Pedra do Sal steps, where weekly live concerts celebrate the birth of Rio samba here in the 19th century.
Two of Brazilâs best walking tour companies offer guided visits to the area, which can include the Pedra do Sal samba shows.

Bucket List Experience
At just over 1,000m, Tijuca Peak is the highest of Rioâs boulder-mountains, and the views from the summit are spectacular â with Rioâs stunning landscape of bays and forest-covered mountains at your feet.
The hike itself is one of the best walks in Tijuca National Park â cutting through wildlife-filled forest, before climbing steeply through a long staircase of steps literally cut into the rock face. Itâs easily done as a round trip in around 3 hours, and you can visit Tijucaâs waterfalls or even the Christ the Redeemer statue on Corcovado on the way back. Plenty of Rio tour operators offer the hike.

Hike to Telegraph Rock
Rio de Janeiro, Southeastern Region, Brazil
Experience
This beautiful and little-known two-hour trail hugs the coastline between Barra de Guaratiba village in Rioâs extreme southern suburbs and the long crescent moon surf beach at Grumari.
The path climbs through protected rainforest, affording wonderful views over the long, wild beaches of da Marambaia and from the Telegraph Rock lookout (with a seemingly endless spread of beaches and mountains at your feet). It then drops to a series of rocky coves and bays before emerging on long, pearl-white Grumari beach.
Thereâs wildlife to see on the way â electric blue Morpho Blue butterflies as big as a handkerchief, hummingbirds, capuchin monkeys and soaring frigate birds. And the bottle-green, surf and body-surf friendly sea at Grumari is as fresh and clean as youâll find anywhere in Rio.

Hike up Gavea Rock
Rio de Janeiro , Southeastern Region, Brazil
Experience
This hulking 842m-high granite monolith, Pedra da Gavea, towers above both Corcovado and Sugar Loaf; the 6-hour hike up through the wildlife-filled rainforests of the Tijuca National Park is ultimately rewarded with some of the best views in Rio.
Even in high season, youâll share the experience with just a handful of other walkers. The catch is that itâs a half-day hike and a scary rope-secured scramble to the summit, making this a challenge solely for the vertigo-tolerant, fit, agile and wild at heart.
Climb in Rio lead a range of guided climbs up Pedra da Gavea for the more serious mountain climber.

The walk is easy â hugging the coast around Botafogo Bay â before climbing through dense forest, winding past myriad spectacular viewpoints and reaching the summit of the hill. It takes around 45 minutes to complete one way. Thereâs plenty of wildlife to see en route â tiny, tufted-eared marmoset and brown capuchin monkeys, brilliantly-coloured tanagers and hummingbirds. And itâs straightforward to catch the cable car up to Sugarloaf or back to ground level.

Hong Kong
China
Destination guide
Asia’s most cosmopolitan city dazzles like no other, with its pretty puzzle of mountains and harbour, malls and markets, high-rises, temples and trams.
The landscape constantly amazes, while the pace of life is relentlessly exciting day and night â Hong Kong doesnât so much tick boxes as fill them out in technicolour.
Superb food and shopping are two of Hong Kongâs main draws, but don’t come expecting the bargains of yesteryear from the city’s famous markets.
However, Hong Kongâs million-dollar harbourside views won’t cost you a bean, and the five-minute hop across Victoria Harbour on the iconic Star Ferry is the perfect introduction to the city.

Aqua Luna
Hong Kong, China
Bucket List Experience
Instantly recognisable by the trio of scarlet sails, junk boats â tall, wooden three-mast vessels – once filled the waters around Hong Kong, providing homes for thousands of residents. Until as recently as the 1970s, many families lived, ate, worked and slept on board, travelling between the islands of the archipelago, and pulling into the harbours when typhoons struck.
In recent decades, families have swapped their boats for apartments in the city, and now only a handful of junks remain. The Aqua Luna is one of the last still sailing in Hong Kong waters, and there is no more cinematic way to appreciate the skyline city from the water. Lie on the open deck under stiff fan sails, glass of wine in hand and a cooling breeze, as you glide through Victoria Harbour.
Aqua Luna has two boats â the red-sailed Aqua Luna and the blue and white Dragon-sailed Aqua Luna II. Between them, they offer a number of different itineraries, day and night, including an afternoon dim sum tour, an after-dark Symphony of Lights tour and day trips to Stanley Village on the south side of the island.

Po Lin Monastery
Hong Kong, China
Bucket List Experience
The century-old Po Lin monastery is the most famous centre of Buddhism in Hong Kong, and offers visitors an insight into the spiritual side of the city.
Two towering Pai Lau (entrance gates) mark the beginning of the complex, which comprises three halls, and many smaller buildings. Inside, the three main halls are vivid with ornate gold decorations and infused with the scent of incense. The Grand Hall of 10,000 Buddhas is a must-see; named for the thousands of glowing Buddhas in the vast main room.
The star attraction, though, is the 112ft-high bronze Buddha, seated meditatively upon a lotus base modelled on the âaltar of heavenâ. Weighing in at a staggering 250 tonnes, the statue is situated 268 steps above the main complex. There are wonderful views from the base of the Buddha across Lantau â Hong Kongâs largest and greenest island.

Wong Tai Sin Temple
Hong Kong, China
Bucket List Experience
Set against a backdrop of high-rises and swathed in incense smoke, this is one of Hong Kongâs largest Taoist temples.
Named after Wong Tai Sin (a mythical shepherd boy with the power of healing), devotees flock here at Lunar New Year, but itâs popular the rest of the year as well, mostly for the ranks of fortune-tellers lined up outside.
Behind the temple are some attractive gardens â a miniature copy of Beijingâs Summer Palace â with colourful pavilions, fish ponds and waterfalls.

Boat tours of Victoria Harbour
Hong Kong, China
Bucket List Experience
Hong Kongâs world-famous harbour sits in an arena of skyscrapers and verdant hills, offering a spectacular perspective on the city. Its deep waters and location on the South China Sea were key to Hong Kongâs establishment as a British colony in the mid-19th century.
A trip around or across the harbour offers the chance to contrast mainland China with the unique atmosphere and pace of Hong Kong island â for mere pennies.
The cheapest and simplest way in on the iconic Star Ferry â a standard ferry route that connects Hong Kong Island with Kowloon. The Star Ferry has been in operation since 1888, before which time passengers crossed the harbour in oar-powered sampans. The early Star Ferries were steamboats. The Star Ferry Company also operate a harbour tour in the double-decker Shining Star, a re-creation of these ferries that plied the harbour in the 1920s.
A more traditional, cultural option is a tour on a traditional red-sail junk. Or you can go luxury, and book in for one of the luxury dinner cruises, often with a buffet dinner and sometimes a live band on board.

Victoria Peak
Hong Kong, China
Bucket List Experience
Known locally simply as ‘The Peak’, this is the highest point on Hong Kong Island, 552m above sea level. In colonial times, it was a favourite summer retreat of the British, who were carried up the hill on sedan chairs to escape the sweltering, sticky heat. Development was limited until a funicular tram was completed in 1888.
Nowadays, the steep funicular tram ride up is part of the fun and â on a clear day â the views across the city and harbour, and up to the mountains of Kowloon, are incredible.
Once you get to the top, escape the crowds and the merchandising hard-sell by walking around the mountain along Harlech Road and Lugard Road.

Temple Street Market
Hong Kong, China
Bucket List Experience
Sure, Temple Street Night Market is touristy, but itâs also terrific fun and still somewhere itâs possible to bag a bargain. More than just a place to burn cash, this is also one of Hong Kongâs oldest neighbourhoods; a place where pensioners gather to play mah-jong in the parks and lovelorn youngsters seek the advice of fortune tellers (tourists are also welcome to try face and palm readings and astrological charts).
Aside for the usual souvenirs â faux silk pyjamas, Bruce Lee t-shirts, novelty chopsticks â you can also pick up good quality leather bags, pretty wooden ornaments and cool gadgets. Donât’ be afraid to haggle hard, just remember to keep it friendly.

Hong Kongâs best food & drink
Hong Kong, China
Bucket List Experience
To quote the late Anthony Bourdain, âin Hong Kong you donât take the tour bus to find good food. . . just press start’. This is one of the worldâs greatest foodie cities, packed with over 15,000 restaurants offering mind-boggling variety and a galaxy of Michelin stars.
And while youâll find every kind of food imaginable â from Nepalese dumplings to French fine dining â it’s with home-grown, Cantonese dishes that Hong Kong really excels. Seasonal vegetables and super-fresh seafood are key ingredients, and dim sum is not to be missed â the city starts its day with steaming baskets of har gao (shrimp dumplings) and char sui bao (barbecue pork buns).

Hong Kongâs must-see architecture
Hong Kong, China
Bucket List Experience
With space at a premium, the only way is up in Hong Kong. It’s made the city’s skyline a sight to behold, a forest of skyscrapers rippling down mountainsides and across the harbour front. A few buildings dominate: the Sir Norman Foster-designed HSBC Bank building, I.M. Pei’s Bank of China, and, on the Kowloon side, the 118-storey International Commerce Centre, one of the tallest buildings in the world.
In-between you’ll find a wild diversity of architectural styles, tracing the city’s literal and metaphorical rise, from tiny ancient Taoist temples, to 1930s tong lau tenements, to the brutalist Chinese University of Hong Kong Campus, and the enormous ‘monster building’ housing estate.

Hong Kong Museum of Art
Hong Kong, China
Experience
Hong Kongâs most prolific museum has one of the worldâs largest permanent displays of Chinese fine art and antiquities, as well as local contemporary art, all set against the beautiful backdrop of Victoria Harbour.
A wide variety of visiting exhibitions maintains the museumâs international outlook, whilst an interesting collection of historical paintings and prints shows the visual change of Hong Kong from the 18th century.
The Historical Pictures Gallery is one of the highlights, with Chinese watercolours, oil paintings and pencil drawings depicting the region in and around Hong Kong from the late 18th century through to the late 19th century. Ideal for a rainy day, or if the outdoor humidity starts to overwhelm.

Stanley Market
Hong Kong, China
Bucket List Experience
The market stalls and shops here give new meaning to the term âhiggledy-piggledyâ. The seaside location is uplifting, and there are plenty of restaurants and cafÃ©s dotted around for a pit-stop along the way.
There are no huge bargains to be had, but the sheer variety is impressive â everything from cheap clothing, art and bric-a-brac, to bamboo bird cages, embroidered silk and gadgets (you canât buy fake watches here).
Donât be afraid to bargain, particularly if youâre buying more than one item. Vendors will often knock 10% off the original asking price.
Good for age: 8+

Tai O fishing village
Hong Kong, China
Bucket List Experience
Hong Kong is sky-piercing buildings, heaving crowds and honking red taxies, but itâs also scenic coastline, tranquil beaches and stilted houses. To experience this alternative side to the city head to Tai O, a tiny fishing village tucked away in the wilds of Lantau.
Alighting from the ferry, visitors are immediately greeted with smell of shrimp paste drying in the sun, the industry which has sustained the village for the last few hundred years. From here, narrow alleyways lead to seafood restaurants stilted over the water (you should definitely stay for lunch), garishly-painted temples and tiny village houses clad in aluminium to deflect the sun.
Pair a visit to Tai O with a boat trip from Lantau to see the worldâs pinkest wild dolphins, which swim in the waters around the island. The boat winds its way through the waterways of the historic village before tracking the dolphins, instantly recognisable for their salmon-pink colour.

Horse racing at Happy Valley
Hong Kong , China
Bucket List Experience
More than just a pastime, horse racing has been an intrinsic part of life in Hong Kong for over 150 years, with their importance even mentioned by former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping who promised ‘the horse racing will continue’, even after the city returned to China.
There are two famous racecourses, both offer an energetic insight into the city’s intense love of gambling. Happy Valley Racecourse is the older and more atmospheric of the two. Surrounded by high-rise residential blocks, itâs a massive arena filled with delirious punters, noisy party-goers, men and women, young and old all betting small fortunes on every race. Lunar New Year and the first and last races of the season generally attract the biggest fields.

Chinese Opera
Hong Kong, China
Bucket List Experience
Chinese Opera, an art form known as Xiqu, has been an integral part of traditional Chinese culture for two centuries. A uniquely Chinese combines elaborate costume, singing and dancing, itÂ was apparently started in 1790 when the ‘Four Great Anhui Troupes’ went to perform for the Imperial Court in Beijing.
The landmark Xiqu Theatre in West Kowloon, dedicated to the art form, has made Chinese opera a lot more accessible to visitors. Performances, in Chinese, traditionally last for four hours; however, if that’s too daunting, the centre offers a shorter 90-minute version â with dim sum â in the Tea House. Itâs specially designed to introduce new audiences to Cantonese opera.

Hike the Dragonâs Back
Hong Kong, China
Experience
While Lantau Island has the MacLehose Trail, Hong Kong Island has the Dragon’s Back. This dazzling urban hike rises and falls over 5 miles of sub-tropical terrain looping around the east of the island, from Shek O beach to Big Wave Bay. It takes around 2 hours.
There are some spectacular views to be had along the way, out across the South China Sea, over to Lamma Island and of the city’s skyscrapers dancing in the distance.

Hike the MacLehose Trail
Hong Kong, China
Bucket List Experience
Around 40 per cent of Hong Kong is country park, and the exhilarating MacLehose hiking trail runs between the east and west coasts of the New Territories, along the mountains that gave Kowloon its name.
Passing some stunning beaches, and with amazing urban and rural panoramas along the way, this is a part of Hong Kong many visitors miss altogether. The trail is 100km long, but can be tackled in individual stages.
If you only do one part of the trail, Section 2 â which starts at the East Dam of High Island Reservoir and ends at Indian Ocean-gorgeous Tai Long Wan beach. It covers 13.5kms of forests, coast and mountains peaks and takes around five hours to complete, but the effort is rewarded with the chance to lounge on the sands and soak up the sea views.

Visiting an old police station doesn’t sound terribly arresting, but this one is bang on. Originally built in the mid-19th century to house crooks and conmen, it was meticulously restored by The Jockey Club and reopened in 2019 as a vibrant arts and heritage hub.
Former cells and courts have been transformed into galleries and interactive museums, and the multi-level courtyards are now home to some of the hippest bars and restaurants in the city.

The terraces form when warm natural springs of water, containing high concentrations of dissolved calcium bicarbonate, cascade over the edge of the cliff. As the water cools, calcium forms and deposits harden creating an unusual series of terraced shelves and ridges â and between them, natural spa baths.

Itâs rare to experience a city quite so rich in architectural detailing, not least inscriptions, statuary and restored facades.

Hike the Lycian Way
Mediterranean Region, Turkey
Bucket List Experience
The Lycian Way â or Lykia Yolu â is a rugged and scenic hike through ancient Lyciaâs epic coastlands from Fethiye to Antalya.
At around 540km in entirety, it takes 25-30 days to hike the whole trail. Thankfully, itâs readily enjoyed in manageable chunks â as day walks or in longer sections where overnight accommodation allows.
Some wonderful ancient sites â like Olympos, Patara, Sidyma and the Roman aqueduct at Delikkemer â lie on the route of the Lycian Way; visiting them provides a long dayâs walking with fascinating archaeological punctuation points.
The waymarking can be intermittent by European standards, but the combination of magnificent landscapes littered with historically resonant ruins and the hospitality of the locals truly makes for exceptional, if often demanding, walking.
Itâs a great way to immerse oneself in the rural life, history and culture of Mediterranean Turkey.

Boat tours of the Dalyan River [hot springs & mud baths]
Dalyan, Aegean Region, Turkey
Bucket List Experience
Dalyanâs fleet of shaded timber caiques, which operate from the riverbank in the centre of the town, are the key to these wonderful waterways, and offer two different experiences, whether you travel up or downstream.
Downstream, the caiques range through the channels that wind among the reed beds, allowing stops at the ancient ruins at Kaunos and the turtle beach (also known as Iztuzu Beach) at the deltaâs mouth. A wide stretch of sand, with a simple cafÃ©, there are loungers and parasols to hire, and the sea is shallow and safe for swimming.
Heading upstream are sulphur mud baths at several locations; boats stop to allow time for slathering the mineral-rich mud onto your skin. Koycegiz lake, the final stop, offers the chance of a dip to rinse off any remaining mud. Itâs wonderfully rich in birdlife too.
Other operators offer guided kayaking trips, stopping at all the main sights and great for spotting wildlife.

Best ancient sites on the Turquoise Coast
Turkey
Bucket List Experience
In Greco-Roman terms it pays to think of southwest Turkey as eastern Greece, as the extraordinary profusion of ancient cities, temples and other sites demonstrate.
These lands, home to Herodotus, Homer and Heraclitus among other major historical figures, are an archaeological paradise, with tumbledown theatres, bathhouses, temples, fountains, defensive walls, and tombs at every turn.
The ruins, often wonderfully âunimprovedâ in beautiful natural settings, generally show rich evidence of later civilisations including the Byzantines and Ottomans.
The crowds that comparable European sites attract are thankfully absent, and the access is largely unlimited.

Best markets on the Turquoise Coast
Turquoise Coast, Turkey
Bucket List Experience
Every town of any size in Turkey has a weekly market; a travelling circus that moves each day to different places in each region.
Those in predominantly tourist resorts do have less of a locals feel, but almost all will have kitchenware and household stalls alongside fake designer handbags and clothes, leatherware, jewellery and beautiful handmade backgammon sets.
Markets in places such as Yalikavak, Alacati, Fethiye, Mugla and Kas also have wonderful fruit and veg sections, often with pop up stalls selling freshly-made gozleme (thin flatbreads filled with feta cheese or spicy potato) and ayrun (a traditional yoghurt drink).
Even if youâre not a shopper, this is a great place to people watch â to experience a slice of authentic Turkish life.

Saklikent Gorge [walking]
Kalkan, Mediterranean Region, Turkey

At 300m deep, Turkeyâs most dramatic gorge makes for a wonderful walk and wade along some 4kms of its full 18km extent.
At the sheer-sided entrance, where the Dargaz River runs strong, raised walkways lead to the trail where the water in places rises to the chest, with some moderate clambering.
After returning along the canyon, retire to one of the charmingly rickety waterside eateries clustered beyond the entrance, where the stream runs wide and shallow.
Or hire a tube to float and bounce downstream for a few kilometres in the company of experienced guides, expecting the odd bump and bruise if the water is low.

Hammam on the Turquoise Coast
Turkey
Bucket List Experience
The hamam â the Turkish Bath â is one of Turkeyâs quintessential experiences: a deep cleanse, sweat-out, relax and (optional) heavy-duty massage all in one. Additional services include a massage and a rub-down with a kese (an abrasive glove), to remove layers of dead skin.
For the authentic experience, head to the local hamam. Most towns have one, many occupying historic buildings with elegant vestibules and changing cubicles where, swathed in towels, you can recover with a glass of tea. Many luxury hotels will also have a hamam, and offer a more personalised, private experience.
In the more touristy towns, hamams tend to be unisex, or at least include unisex times in their schedules. Elsewhere, there are separate exits, or schedules, for men and women.

Oludeniz Beach
Fethiye, Mediterranean Region, Turkey
Bucket List Experience
The beach that launched a thousand brochure covers, Oludeniz combines a gorgeous swathe of sandy beach with a tranquil lagoon, backed by tamarisk trees and mountains.
The beach is the most famous in Turkey and does get busy â the further you walk from the resort end, the more chance of peace and quiet. The lagoon is ideal for families with clear, shallow, water and relaxed beach clubs, offering good Turkish food and loungers under the trees.
And while Turkeyâs signature beach is busy with landing paragliders and banana boats, the adjacent lagoon is very much more somnolent: mountain-backed shallows, lined by tamarisk trees, loungers and ice-cream cabins, which offer easy swimming and shade.

Canyoning on the Turquoise Coast
Mediterranean Region, Turkey
Bucket List Experience
Blessed with a succession of limestone valleys and gorges, drained by deep fissures and gulleys, the Turquoise Coast is a prime location for the adventure sport of canyoning.
Dressed in wet suits and safety helmets, youâll descend the canyon in the company of trained guides. From there, it’s a mix of swimming, walking, scrambling, abseiling down waterfalls and jumping into clear pools.

Patara Beach & Ancient Ruins
Kalkan, Mediterranean Region, Turkey
Bucket List Experience
The pristine sand beach at Patara, at the mouth of the Xanthos (Esen) River delta, runs for some 15 kilometres from Karadere in the west to the superb ancient port ruins at Patara.
The main approach is through the low-key village of GelemiÅ, where Ibrahimâs Durak Restaurant offers a superb lunch spot, to the ancient site.
Prioritise visits to the theatre and the adjacent parliament building; the energetic may continue as far as the lighthouse, currently under restoration, before cutting through the dunes to the beach.
The alternative is to return to the road and follow it for a hundred metres beyond the ancient site to where duckboards lead to the beach.
Be mindful of the restrictions: Patara is an important nesting site for endangered loggerhead turtles, and closes after sunset between May and October to allow the turtles to come onto the beach and lay their eggs free of any disturbance. For this reason, sightings of turtles are uncommon, as they rarely venture onto the beach by day.

Butterfly Valley, Turquoise Coast
Fethiye, Mediterranean Region, Turkey

Paragliding off Babadag Mountain
Fethiye, Mediterranean Region, Turkey
Bucket List Experience
The unique topography of Babadag Mountain, which rises 2,000m above the resort beach at Oludeniz, makes this one of the worldâs top sites for tandem paragliding.
Take the road or newly-opened cable car to the summit where, harnessed to your pilot-guide and paraglider, youâll step off the launch platform for thin air where the warm thermals will sweep you up and away.
The route taken by your pilot will depend upon the wind conditions, but expect him/her to make zig-zags on your descent before landing.
Your descent, with spectacular views over the famed lagoon, the Bay of Fethiye and Greek Rhodes, may take as much as half an hour before your guide brings you safely to land on Oludenizâs wide sand beach. Step out of your harness â and straight into the sea.

Costa Rica
Costa Rica
Destination guide
This little Central American country is half the size of Virginia yet it packs in a continentâs worth of landscapes. There are dramatic mountain ranges studded with smoking volcanoes, wild beaches pounded by rolling surf and fringed with coral reef and pristine, bird-trilling rainforests.
More than ten percent of the countryâs landscapes are protected. Youâre coming here for the wealth of wildlife â from vast schools of hammerhead sharks gathering over reefs at Cocos Island, to the turtle-wriggling beaches of Tortuguero and the jaguar-prowled forests of the Osa Peninsula. See it all on canopy walkways and zip-lines, kayaking or white-water rafting down rainforest-choked rivers, or hiking to see waterfalls.

Dive with hammerhead sharks at Cocos Island
Cocos Islands, Puntarenas Province, Costa Rica
Bucket List Experience
Cocos Island, in the deep Pacific, some 550km off the Costa Rican coast, is one of the top dive destinations in the Americas and together with the Galapagos one of the best destinations for marine wildlife in the Eastern Pacific.
It’s alsoÂ the site of one of the great underwater spectacles â the mass schooling of hundreds of hammerhead sharks.
Each year, from June through October, they gather in uncountable numbers, attracted by high concentrations of prey. Cocos Island sits at a convergence of swirling, nutrient-rich currents, attracting vast schools of fish on which the hammerheads feed.
Whale sharks are also regular visitors to the waters around Cocos, making it a popular location for wildlife filmmakers.
Although officially tagged as a âman-eaterâ, hammerheads are shy of humans and attacks are extremely rare. They hunt on the ocean floor at night, feeding on stingrays (their favourite food), squid, mackerel, sardines and octopus.
Their strange hammer-shaped head contains hundreds of small electrical sensors that they use to detect the faint electromagnetic fields generated by their prey hiding beneath the sand.

Itâs a thrilling ride and an essential stop for adrenaline junkies.

Best National Parks in Costa Rica
Costa Rica
Bucket List Experience
Protected jungles and reefs preserving an astonishing 900 bird species and nearly 250 mammals; fuming volcanoes swathed in cloud forest; tens of kilometres of beaches nested by critically-endangered turtles; no army (the money goes to education) and political stabilityâ¦
Costa Ricaâs status as a pioneer of sustainability and peace in turbulent Latin America is remarkable.
As is the story of this success. After World War II, 65% of the wild had gone to aggressive agriculture. Then a few mavericks took a stand â like Scandinavian hippy turned pioneer eco-campaigner Olaf Wessburg, who lost his life fighting to preserve the Osa Peninsula.
And Latin America’s ‘David Attenborough’ Mario Boza, whose relentless force of will inspired the wife of the president, led to Ley Forestal law of 1969 and the founding of 28 national parks. These now form the backbone of protected areas, covering 30% of the country.

Arenal Volcano National Park [Zip-lining, white-water rafting, mountain biking & hiking]
Alajuela Province, Costa Rica
Bucket List Experience
For just over forty years Arenal was one of the worldâs safest active volcanoes to visit â a rumbling cone set in lush forest, spewing out lava that glowed red in the night.
Today, Arenal sleeps but remains truly spectacular â oozing hot rivers and springs, with a near-perfect cone, fuming puffs of gas, and shrouded in black ash. On its slopes, lush forest fringes crumbling, congealed lava fields, and the trees are rich in wildlife â including peccaries, ocelots and capuchin monkeys.
The forests are beautiful, cut with numerous wildlife trails and dripping with waterfalls. There are spectacular views of the mountainsâ perfect cone at every turn â framed by rainforest trees.
The entire area is protected as a national park, a larger conservation area and a series of private reserves â all part of the 204,000-hectare Arenal Conservation Area.
Over the years, a series of luxurious hotels and a string of hot river spas grew around its flanks and ecotourism parks with canopy walkways â at toucanâs eye level â were built in the beautiful cloud forests around the mountain.
Itâs illegal and potentially dangerous to summit the mountain itself, but there are great hikes in the area; trails run across lava fields through pine woods filled with peccary and parakeets. Other trails lead to waterfalls like the 75m-high La Fortuna, which drops into a refreshing, clear-water pool that you can hike to and swim in.
Thereâs a range of other bucket list things to do in and around the national park too.
Canopy walkways offer monkey-eye views and the park environs have some of the countryâs longest and fastest zip lines. Thereâs also rainforest river kayaking, tubing and white-water rafting, mountain biking and canyoning.

Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve [zip-line]
Monteverde, Alajuela Province, Costa Rica
Bucket List Experience
Spread across rugged mountains 1,400m above sea level, this private reserve (and adjacent protected areas) covers more than 10,000 hectares of wildlife-rich, misty cloud forest.
This is where dedicated twitchers come to combe the 15kms of trails in search of the resplendent quetzal, the brightly-plumed bird sacred to the Mayas.
But there is plenty of other wildlife to discover â from spider monkeys and over 400 bird species, to wild orchids and prehistoric ferns â andÂ a variety of ways to explore Monteverde.
Walking trails lead through a forest encrusted with orchids and covered in thick carpets of dripping moss (there are day and night safaris available). Canopy walkways and cable cars run through the trees, affording an eagleâs eye view of the extraordinary landscape, or you can see it at high-speed on a zip-line experience.

Whale-watching in the Ballena Marine National Park
Ballena Marine National Park, Puntarenas Province, Costa Rica
Bucket List Experience
Humpback whales migrate to the Costa Rican Pacific from Antarctica and North America â to court and mate in the warm waters, later calving in the shallow seas of this marine national park. With near year-round visits, this is one of the best places to see humpbacks with their young in the Americas.
The Ballena Marine National Park protects the marine area around four small islands where the whales congregate. The islands have become a haven for other marine life; Olive Ridley and hawksbills turtles, boobies and pelicans, and dolphins are a common sight.

Natural spas and hot springs in Costa Rica
Costa Rica
Bucket List Experience
With dozens of active and dormant volcanoes oozing hot springs and even rivers, and well-developed tourist infrastructure, Costa Rica is one of the best places in the world for geothermal pampering.
Thereâs a big choice of things to do. In locations like VolcÃ¡n Tenorio and Rincon de la Vieja, it is still possible to find natural hot rivers flowing in pristine rainforest. Others in locations like Arenal have been diverted through man-made pools â set in designated day spas.
At the highest end are luxury geothermal spa hotels (usually open to guests only), where volcanic spring water flows directly into the spa or even into your personal in-room bath or plunge pool.

Corcovado National Park
Osa Peninsula, Puntarenas Province, Costa Rica
Bucket List Experience
The last remaining stand of coastal Pacific rainforest in Central America is protected by this, the crown jewel in Costa Ricaâs park system â a sprawling 425sq km reserve that occupies much of the Osa Peninsula.
Itâs a National Geographic special waiting to happen: a riot of lush forest occupied by bellowing monkeys, snorting peccaries and noisy flocks of scarlet macaws â not to mention elusive night-time species such as pumas and jaguars.
The marine areas around the Osa Peninsula are an important breeding ground for dolphins and whales. Lodges can arrange boating trips in search of these incredible mammals.
Cabo Matapalo, at the south-eastern tip of the Osa Peninsula, is blessed with a good point break. Most lodges can arrange lessons, surfboard rentals and transport.
Good for age: 13+
Duration: 2 days

Coffee & cocoa plantation tours
Costa Rica
Bucket List Experience
Costa Rica produces fine coffee â smooth, mildly acidic (depending on altitude) and floral. Coffee haciendas (plantations) dot Costa Ricaâs Central Valley, Pacific coast foothills and northern highlands.
A number can be visited â on day tours. You can learn how the beans are grown and harvested, taste varieties produced under different conditions, see the cacao fruit, and the process which turns its seeds into chocolate.
You can even stay in an upscale coffee hacienda as an overnight stop on your way in or out of the country. Thereâs a scattering of them near the international airport, set in beautiful semi-wild surrounds.
Adult price: Â£30

Turtles in Tortuguero National Park
Limon Province, Costa Rica
Bucket List Experience
Tortuguero National Park, on Costa Ricaâs northeastern Caribbean coast, is the best place in the northern Atlantic to see nesting and hatching sea turtles; four species can be seen including giant leatherbacks.
The dominant species is the Green Turtle â Tortugueroâs black sand beach is the most important nesting site for the species in the Western Hemisphere, thanks to half a century of conservation. Visit in the right months and sightings are virtually guaranteed.
Thereâs much more besides â some 160 species of reptiles and amphibians, 60 species of mammals and 300+ species of birds. Shoreside lagoons, filled with crocodiles stretch back from the beaches; gallery forests are busy with capuchin monkeys, toucans, spider monkeys, iguanas and three-toed sloths.
Lush hills rise above the whole landscape â offering stunning viewpoints that look as wild and primeval as the Jurassic World.
See it all on short hikes, boat excursions on the long lagoons or by kayak.
But this is wilderness with ease and comfort â there are accommodation options for adults of all ages and families with even the youngest kids.
Good for age: 8+

Cahuita National Park
Cahuita, Limon Province, Costa Rica
Experience
Just outside the laid-back little one-street village of Cahuita, this Atlantic coastal national park protects long sandy beaches, beautiful offshore reefs and crocodile-filled creeks and rivers.
Ocelots live in the rainforest behind the coast and Cahuita is an important turtle-nesting ground.
The park has exceptional biodiversity and species variety because it is contiguous with the huge UNESCO World Heritage listed Parque Internacional La Amistad (shared with neighbouring Panama) and the Refugio Nacional Gandoca-Manzanillo; together they make one of the largest wilderness areas on the Caribbean coast of Central America.
Good for age: 8+

La Fortuna Waterfall
Arenal National Park, Alajuela Province, Costa Rica
Experience
Lost at the end of a steep trail in misty forest on the fringes of Arenal National Park, this beautiful 75m-high waterfall drops into a refreshing, clear-water pool surrounded by moss-covered boulders.
Itâs a 10-minute walk down a 500-step wooden staircase to get there (and 15-minutes back up) from the car park, but it’s an idyllic spot, worth the walk, and a wonderful place to swim. Go early though â it gets crowded, fast.
Good for age: 13+

Poas Volcano
Poas Volcano National Park, Alajuela Province, Costa Rica
Experience
Want to peer into the crater of an active volcano? The easiest place to do it is Poas â in ash-spewing distance of the international airport and with a car park practically on its rim.
Though framed by trail-cut, fern-filled forest, the crater itself is moonlike â shallow, broad and desolate, but for brilliant-green and milky-grey lakes which occasionally steam or belch gas. The lookout platform hovers over the rim of the crater: thereâs no lava â but with visits this close to the edge, most visitors are relieved rather than disappointed.
Adult price: Â£10

Piedras Blancas National Park
Osa Peninsula, Puntarenas Province, Costa Rica
Experience
Piedras Blancas is far less visited or well-known than neighbouring Corcovado National Park on the Osa peninsula, yet itâs equally biodiverse and its landscapes are even more stunning.
The primary rainforest drips with waterfalls and drops to a deep-water fjord where whales calve; black sand beaches spread to extensive mangrove forests.
The hiking, kayaking and scuba diving are wonderful.
Good for age: 8+

Guanacaste Conservation Area
Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica
Experience
Costa Rica is justifiably famous for its rain and cloud forests. Less well-known are the countryâs tropical dry forests.
This 147,000-hectare UNESCO World Heritage-listed biome preserves the largest stretch in Central America, through a series of public and private protected areas.
The landscapes â from volcanoes to empty beaches and mangrove swamps â are breathtaking and the area is home to spectacular rare animals including the endangered Central American tapir, jaguar and ocelot. Critically endangered leatherback turtles nest on the beaches.

Beijing
China
Destination guide
The Chinese capital sits at the heart of the national consciousness as its political, cultural and emotional nexus.
A vast city, Beijing is best known for its ancient temples, palaces and proximity to the Great Wall of China, but dig a little deeper and youâll find a thriving contemporary art scene, walkable old neighbourhoods with stylish cafes and boutiques, and a culinary safari of regional Chinese delicacies.
A megacity in the making, vast malls and skyscrapers are juxtaposed with a shrinking number of charming traditional hutong (historic residential alleyways) and backstreet lanes.
Greater affluence and an increasingly youthful vibe have created a diverse dining and nightlife scene, while mall shopping is a well-catered-to pastime for Beijingers.

Forbidden City
Beijing, China
Bucket List Experience
Built in the early 15th century, the Forbidden City is a vast palace complex of regal halls, ceremonial courtyards, gardens and living quarters, that served as the home of Chinese emperors and their households for 500 years. Behind its vermilion walls was a closed-off world of antique ritual and intrigue, where the âSon of Heavenâ was tended to by an army of servants, eunuchs and concubines.
Today the palace complex is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the world’s largest collection of heritage wooden buildings. Officially called the Palace Museum, many of the rooms have been given over to museum exhibits of imperial treasures, from priceless ceramics to Qing-dynasty furniture.
Its central location, historic importance and architectural beauty make this Beijingâs most popular site of interest for tourists.

Great Wall of China [hiking & helicopter flights]
Beijing, China
Bucket List Experience
The monumental Great Wall of China is a defense work stretching from ocean to desert across the vast expanse of Chinaâs northern regions. In the strategic uplands around Beijing, the Wall was built from bricks and stone, with crenelated battlements and watchtowers. Elsewhere it was more simply fashioned from tamped earth.
The Great Wall is actually a series of walls built during different eras of Chinese history, but the first unifying wall was constructed by Chinaâs first emperor, Qin Shi Huang, from around 220 BC. Much of the wall that remains standing today was reconstructed using stronger materials during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).
Later sections of the Great Wall â including Badaling, the first section to be opened to tourists â stand on average 8m tall and just under 6m wide, designed to allow five horses to ride abreast or ten soldiers to walk shoulder to shoulder.
The nearest stretches to Beijing have been restored and are now among the worldâs most visited tourist spots. Unrestored sections, sometimes called the âwild wallâ, remain in a precarious state of ruin, with an estimated thirty percent already lost to the vagaries of weather, earthquakes and human activity. Around Beijing, the undulating mountain landscapes are as inspiring as the defensive ramparts themselves.

Beijingâs best temples and shrines
Beijing, China
Bucket List Experience
Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism, the three ancient belief systems of China, each have their own temple sites in Beijing.
At White Cloud Temple you might see grey-robed Taoist monks with their hair gathered in topknots, while at the Lama Temple, Buddhist acolytes in saffron-hued robes come and go between the incense-shrouded halls. The Confucius Temple, being more a memorial than a place of worship, has dozens of stone stelae inscribed with the names of famous scholars.
All three styles are architecturally similar, comprising a symmetrical series of halls and courtyards rising in importance the deeper one moves into the temple complex.
There are also many Islamic Chinese in Beijing; the Niujie Mosque dates back 1,000 years and is the cityâs largest.
Despite its name, the Temple of Heaven isnât a temple but an imperial altar used for esoteric state sacrifices, such as when the emperor would ask heaven for good harvests.

Summer Palace
Beijing, China
Bucket List Experience
The former retreat of Chinaâs imperial rulers, the Summer Palace is a masterpiece of classical Chinese garden design on a truly awesome scale. Artificial hills, lakes, opulent buildings and graceful arched bridges convene in carefully orchestrated harmony.
Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the gardens, 12km northwest of the Forbidden City, were first built in the 12th century but were developed to their artistic height during the Qing Dynasty (1644 – 1912).
Most famously, the Summer Palace became the royal retirement home of Cixi, the Empress Dowager, a formidable character who ruled China from behind the curtain for almost five decades. The palace and itsÂ gardens were remodelled to serve as her private retirement complex.
Thereâs plenty to see and do, from strolling the famous âLong Corridorâ to pleasure boating on Kunming Lake. Several of the palace buildings hold historical artefacts and exhibits, including possessions belonging to the Empress Dowager.

Temple of Heaven
Beijing, China
Bucket List Experience
The Temple of Heaven is unlike any other temple in China. In fact, itâs not really a temple at all but a richly symbolic event space of sorts, where the emperor, accompanied by a grand entourage, would perform arcane rites twice a year to pray for heavenâs blessing.
Ceremonies took place upon the open-air Round Altar, next to the Imperial Vault of Heaven where the spirit tablets of the gods were kept. A 360m-long paved walkway connects to the splendid centrepiece, the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests.
Surrounded by sculpted parkland, the layout of the complex was designed to reflect Chinese cosmology and symbolise the relationship between heaven and earth.

Tiananmen Square
Beijing, China
Bucket List Experience
This vast public space sits at the very heart of modern China, both literally and symbolically. It takes its name from the Gate of Heavenly Peace which divides the square in the north from the Forbidden City, and upon which Mao Zedong proclaimed the founding of the Peopleâs Republic in 1949.
The socialist-realist Great Hall of the People, Chinaâs most important government building, lines the western flank, facing the hulking National Museum across the square.
In the centre is Mao Zedongâs mausoleum and the Monument to the Peoplesâ Heroes. Demarcating the southern boundary are the parallel Zhengyangmen and Arrow Tower city gates.
During the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s, rallies of up to a million Red Guards took place. In 1989, pro-democracy demonstrators took over the square for six weeks before the governmentâs brutal crackdown that sent shockwaves around the world.

Beijingâs best food & drink
Beijing, China

Eating is the most cherished activity in China, and Beijing is no different. Naturally, the capital attracts Chinese chefs and restauranteurs from across its 34 provinces and regions, which means you can feast on fragrant Yunnan rice noodles one day and hearty Inner-Mongolian lamb the next.

During the Qing Dynasty, it became one of the most important religious sites in China, tasked with determining the reincarnations of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama.
The palace-like site unfolds symmetrically through a series of ornamental halls, courtyards and pavilions to its incense-shrouded finale, an 18m tall statue of the Maitreya Buddha carved from a single trunk of Tibetan sandalwood.

Beijingâs imperial history
Beijing, China
Bucket List Experience
The divine middle of the âMiddle Kingdomâ, Beijing has ruled over China since the 13th century. In 1287, Kublai Khan established the Yuan Dynasty and built Khanbaliq, a predecessor to todayâs city. Less than a century later, Khanbaliq was razed by the emergent Ming Dynasty, and Beijing as we know it took shape.
Ming emperor Yongle designed his capital as a compass-perfect exercise in feng shui, with the newly built Forbidden City at its heart. Twenty-four emperors ruled from its hallowed halls, together with their eunuchs and concubines, until revolution swept aside Chinaâs last imperial rulers, the Qing Dynasty, in 1911.

Beijingâs hutongs
Beijing, China
Bucket List Experience
Wandering the atmospheric hutong neighbourhoods is Beijingâs most evocative experience.
Hutongs are residential lanes and alleyways traditionally associated with Beijing and defined by the outer walls of courtyard homes called siheyuan â usually single storey â which join together to form communities. The oldest date back hundreds of years. The word itself is believed to be of Mongol origin, dating back to the Yuan dynasty.
The narrow hutong lanes north of the Forbidden City and around the Drum and Bell Towers and Houhai Lake, are some of the best for strolling, where you might see local residents playing xiangqi, traditional street sellers, and surviving Qing dynasty courtyard architecture.
Explore independently, or hire a guide to explain the unique cultures of the more fascinating hutongs such as those around the Dashilan neighbourhood southwest of Tiananmen Square, which served as Beijingâs red-light district before the Communist revolution.

Traditional performing arts in Beijing
Beijing, China
Bucket List Experience
Beijing is a great place to take your first forays into Chinaâs traditional performing arts.

More accessible is zaji (Chinese acrobatics), thought to be 2,000 years old. Venues like the Chaoyang Theater stage nightly shows where youthful troupes demonstrate feats of almost superhuman agility.
Touring martial arts shows are also popular, often performed by Shaolin monks.

Surrounded by willow trees, winding hutong lanes, bars and restaurants, the lakes are used for leisure boating in spring and summer, and ice skating and ice biking on the frozen waters during winter.
Dating back to the Yuan Dynasty, the man-made lakes once marked the northern terminal of the Grand Canal. Qing nobles built their homes here, and some, such as Prince Gongâs Mansion, can be visited and explored.
The lakes can be a great place to experience local culture, especially early in the morning. On the north shore of Houhai, Beijingers swim in the lake all year round, breaking the ice in winter for a freezing dip.

Mayan Riviera
Mexico
Destination guide
With talcum-powder fine beaches, coral reefs, Mayan temples set in hummingbird-filled jungles and clear-water rivers teeming with life, the Maya Riviera mixes exotic beachside luxury with romantic light adventure.
Itâs great for couples: with strings of romantic, low-lit beachside hotels, where you can sip cocktails in the Jacuzzi to the sound of lapping waves and trilling cicadas. With big resorts with toddler-friendly pools and waterslides, and a legion of carefully-curated adventure parks itâs good for families too.
And thereâs plenty of adventure â with forests littered with astonishing Mayan ruins, reef and cave dives, snorkelling with whale sharks or manatees, creek kayaking, zip-lining and hikes through pristine rainforest.

Swim with wild crocodiles on the Mayan Riviera
Xcalak, Quintana Roo, Mexico
Bucket List Experience
The Mayan Riviera is one of the few places in the world where you can get close to a giant American crocodile and live to tell the tale. And as croc encounters take place in glass-clear water youâll get some great pictures to prove it.
These are generally three day, two-night trips, leaving from the tiny southern Riviera town of Xcalak and travelling out to the remote Banco Chinchorro atoll biosphere reserve. The atollâs eel grass-filled lagoon is home to the largest numbers of American Crocodiles on the planet. Overnight stays are in primitive fishermanâs stilt huts over the water with the crocs swimming around below.
As well as crocodiles, Banco Chinchorro offers a high chance of encounters with manatees, prolific fish life (including big tarpon) and astonishing stars. There are plenty of opportunities to snorkel over pristine reefs en-route, and youâll catch invasive lionfish, which are used to feed the crocs. Some trips include optional scuba diving.
Swims with the reptiles are in clear water around a metre deep and a safety diver accompanies at all times armed with a big stick. According to local tour operators at least, the reptiles have too much food to bother with anything larger than a fish.

Chichen Itza
Piste, Yucatan, Mexico
Bucket List Experience
The UNESCO world heritage-listed Maya city of Chichen Itza is one of Mexicoâs most iconic and spectacular attractions â a global must-see worthy of any bucket list.
The site is littered with stunning, monumental buildings â the towering and perfectly proportioned Castillo pyramid, decorated with plumed serpents, the colonnaded Temple of a Thousand Warriors, vast ball courts and exquisitely carved palaces. These formed the ceremonial heart of a far larger city â built between AD 750 and 1200 â whose ruins extend into the wild forest surrounds.

Temazcal Ceremonies, Mayan Riviera
Mayan Riviera, Mexico
Bucket List Experience
This ancient Mayan purification ceremony is designed to cause an intense physical, emotional and mental release â and a transformative, almost mystical feeling of rebirth. It cleanses and reunites the physical, mental and spiritual forms.
The ceremony takes place in a temazcal, or âsteam houseâ â a small, circular dome made of rocks and mud. The structure has several symbolic components: the dome house (signifying a motherâs womb), the entrance, symbolising rebirth when you come out, a burner where wood is set on fire and a bonfire where the water is heated. All four basic elements â earth, wind, fire and water â are represented.
Itâs led by a local shaman (XâMen, or Mayan priest). Red-hot lava rocks are placed in the center, and doused with water infused with local aromatic herbs. The searing heat generated causes profuse sweating, which combined with inhaling the therapeutic herbs, promotes detoxification. The complete darkness inside liberates the senses from distraction, enabling deep contemplation and meditation, leading to mental balance and mindfulness (presence from the mind). A group energy is generated through chanting and music. At the end, youâll cool off in a cold river or pool, whichÂ  closes the pores and activates the immune system.
A proper ceremony usually lasts up to 3 hours (though shorter, more touristy ones can be as short as one hour). After, youâll leave with a sense of inner harmony, enlightenment and rejuvenation. Other reputed benefits include detoxification, skin cleansing, reduced depression, and reduced risk of dementia.

Swim in a cenote [snorkelling & scuba diving]
Mayan Riviera, Mexico
Bucket List Experience
The Yucatan Peninsula is like a giant pumice stone â riddled with tiny holes, many of which are filled with glassy clear subterranean rivers riddled with stalactite-filled caverns, which break the surface as sinkholes called cenotes. There are hundreds dotted over the peninsula â some lost in thick jungle, others surrounded by Mayan ruins. Some pour into clear-water lakes like Bacalar, or the open ocean.
Swimming in a cenote â tiny fish nibbling your feet, vines and strange rock formations all around you is wonderful. Diving is spectacular; especially for those daring enough to qualify as a cave diver and venture deep into the flooded caverns.
Good for age: 8+
Duration: 1+ hours

Cenote Dos Ojos [swimming, snorkelling & scuba diving]
Tulum, Quintana Roo, Mexico
Bucket List Experience
These twin cenotes are spectacular: marking the entrance to one of the longest underground rivers in the world â filled with water as clear as ocean air, passing through submerged caverns covered with spectacular cave formations and teeming with strange cave fish, crustaceans and bats. The cenotes are a premium cave-diving location and were used as locations for The Cave movie and the BBCâs Planet Earth documentary.
You donât need to be a cave diver to visit. Some of the most beautiful caverns are accessible to snorkellers. PADI open water divers can go further and designated cave divers can explore the deeper caverns. Any diving requires advanced booking.
Adult price: Â£12

Dive with bull sharks on the Mayan Riviera
Playa del Carmen, Quintana Roo, Mexico
Bucket List Experience
Like great whites and tiger sharks, bull sharks have a fearsome reputation. Getting within metres of these apex predators on a carefully controlled dive is astonishing: and in the clear, calm waters off Playa del Carmen, itâs as safe as any such encounter can be.
While bull sharks are present along the Riviera Maya all year round, dives are possible only October through March, when the more placid females enter shallower waters right off the mainland.
To dive you will need an Advanced Open Water Certification. Choose a responsible dive shop, who donât use bait â which can be dangerous, and who follow strict distance regulations.
Adult price: Â£150
Min age 16
Good for age: 16+

Swim with whale sharks on the Mayan Riviera
Isla Mujeres, Quintana Roo, Mexico
Bucket List Experience
Between May and September, the worldâs largest fish visits Riviera Maya waters to feed on the large upswells of plankton from the Gulf of Mexico. Snorkelling with them is an astonishing experience, and takes place in open sea. These giant filter feeders, which can reach over 12 metres are astonishingly well-camouflaged â almost invisible in the inky blue until they are almost next to you, then gently swaying past and back into the depths.
Numerous tour operators in Cancun and Playa del Carmen offer snorkelling and diving trips which usually include reef snorkels and lunch.
Adult price: Â£40
Good for age: 13+

Swim with manatees on the Mayan Riviera
Xcalak, Quintana Roo, Mexico
Bucket List Experience
Swimming with captive manatees (which you can do in Xel-Ha) doesnât have the same magic as encountering these gentle animals in their natural habitat â which is possible on the Mayan Riviera. The region has one of the largest populations of wild West Indian manatees in the world; grazing on eel grass in the sand flats of the Banco Chinchorro and the shallow waters of Chetumal Bay. Both locations are protected marine sanctuaries.
To see manatees, youâll need to travel to the little town of Xcalak in the far south, where tour companies offer trips. Along the way you will almost certainly see turtles, dolphins, huge schools of tarpon and some of the best-preserved coral reefs on the Mayan Riviera.

World-class snorkelling on the Mayan Riviera
Mayan Riviera, Mexico

The Mayan Riviera cannot compare with Indonesia or the Barrier Reef for spectacular corals, or the Maldives for fish life, but there are few locations anywhere which offer a better variety of snorkel experiences.
Reefs lie in swimming distance of the shore, plunging coral walls are a boat ride away, there are underwater art galleries, lakes fringed with jungle and hundreds of cenotes: sink holes filled with terrapins and fish that drop into stalactite-encrusted caverns. You can even snorkel with whale sharks, manatees or crocodiles
Most snorkel excursions are easy to do alone, there are designated family-friendly water parks like Xel-Ha and myriad agencies in the main towns offer boat trips.

The Mayan Riviera offers scuba diving unmatched in variety anywhere else in the world.
The coast is fringed with a long offshore barrier reef dotted with coral islands and with one of just a handful of coral atolls in the Atlantic. The jungle-covered mainland is honeycombed with underground rivers and cenotes, with exceptionally clear water and spectacular cave diving.
You can dive with whale sharks, dolphins and crocodiles, or over underwater art galleries. Sites are rich in species and varied â ranging from spectacular drifts off Cozumel to shipwrecks wrecks galore over the Chinchorro atoll, and while the reef suffers from over-fishing, dive tourism continues to create pressure for the creation of protected areas.

Mayan ruins of Coba
Quintana Roo, Mexico
Bucket List Experience
This conglomeration of Mayan towns, linked by extensive paved walkways and centred on pyramid-lined plazas, was one of the most important Mayan trading centres in its heyday between AD 200 and AD 1400.
Set in lush forest near two pretty lakes, it receives far fewer visitors than Chichen Itza or Tulum and consequently feels more authentic and atmospheric. There are wonderful views from the temple tops, the largest of which is almost 130ft tall.
Look for toucans and spider monkeys in the forest canopy, wild coatimundis, agouti and rare peccaries on the forest paths.

Calakmul
Campeche, Mexico
Bucket List Experience
Calakmul is unforgettable. The giant pyramids of this 2000-year-old ruined city jut out over the largest stretch of rainforest in the Americas north of the Amazon, the Peten.
Calakmul was one of the largest of the Maya cities, built in around 100 BC and occupied for 1,000 years until it was abandoned to the forest. Much of it is protected as a biosphere reserve and the wildlife is exuberant â macaws and toucans flit through the canopy, jaguars hunt in the shadows.
Only a handful of visitors ever make it to this impressive Mayan city, lost in a vast, pristine rainforest. Thatâs a shame but a boon too â itâs remained a magical experience. The sense of being an explorer, isolated in pristine nature is exhilarating.

Laguna Bacalar [swimming & kayaking]
Quintana Roo, Mexico
Bucket List Experience
This beautiful freshwater lake, set in tropical forest and wild orchid meadows, was called âthe place where the sky is bornâ, by the Maya. Its brilliant blue, chalky waters â which are fed by a series of giant cenotes â look like a cloud-filled sky. Thereâs wonderful kayaking and swimming here.
The lake is home to one of the world’s largest numbers of stromatolites, coral-like organisms found in only a handful of places and regarded by biologists as one of the earliest lifeforms on earth.
The best way to explore Bacalar is by kayak. Kayakers should head to the far eastern shore of the lake, where the orchid meadows begin, and to the lakeâs southern extremities where there is wonderful shallow-water swimming.

You can swim with dolphins, nurse sharks and manatees; and there are tame jungles populated with rainforest wildlife, and after-dark, a glitzy Maya âcultural showâ.
Yes, you can the real thing elsewhere. But accept Xcaret as a kind of Maya World Disneyland and itâs great fun.

Aktun-Chen
Akumal, Quintana Roo, Mexico
Experience
With forest canopy zip-lines, cenote-swimming, light caving, and wildlife-watching, this six-acre nature-based theme park set in scrubby jungle mixes safari park-zoo with light adventure in nature.
There are three separate tours which can be done independently or in combination: a zip-line circuit through the trees, snorkelling in a cenote, and/or a tour through a 5 million-year-old cave dripping with stalactites and stalagmites and coursed by a glass-clear underground river.
Facilities are simple â with little more than a Mexican restaurant â but there are far fewer tourist-bus crowds than at nearby Xel-HÃ¡.

Gran Cenote
Tulum, Quintana Roo, Mexico
Bucket List Experience
Covered in fragrant lilies, floating on a terrapin-filled pool of water as clear and fresh as mountain air and framed by a dramatic cave mouth, Gran Cenote is a beauty.

Mayan ruins of Tulum
Tulum, Quintana Roo, Mexico
Experience
This small Maya settlement dating from between AD 564 and 1450, probably served as a port for the larger inland city of Coba.
The buildings, which cluster around a 30m-high stepped pyramid, are modest, but the site has become emblematic of the Riviera Maya because of its magnificent location â perched dramatically on a craggy cliff top overlooking a pristine, white-coral beach and a limpid, aquamarine sea.
Itâs heavily visited and spoilt when there are crowds â its appeal is the beautiful setting rather than the undistinguished ruins themselves.

Cenote Ik Kil
Yucatan, Mexico
Experience
With vertical walls dropping from thick jungle to a deep green pool, and cascades of dripping vines and roots, this atmospheric cenote is set in a 30m-high sinkhole, 60m wide and 40m deep, is an Instagram spectacular.
Itâs also very close to Chichen Itza, making it a great stop before or after a visit there â but it does mean it gets crowded. Few of the hordes of swimmers realise that it was once used as a site of human sacrifice by Maya priests. Archaeologists have found grisly remains â alongside jewellery 50m down on the cenote floor.
The water is deep-green, clean and fresh, and inhabited by tiny black catfish. Itâs not for divers, but swimming (for all ages) is a buzz, and itâs worth taking your snorkel too.

Experience
This unique cenote, also known as Cenote Dzitnup, feels like a secret swimming hole. Set in a low-lit cavern dripping with stalactites, hidden 60ft underground, Xkeken looks like a film set from an Indiana Jones movie. Thereâs only one small, single opening in the ceiling to allow light in â around mid-morning, a single shaft of sunlight shines through, lighting the cavern in brilliant colours.
With small bats nesting on the ceiling, turquoise water and overhanging limestone formations, itâs an atmospheric place for a swim.
But much photographed and much visited, it can get very crowded. So come early or late and youâll share it only with the black cave fish, who gently nibble your feet as you swim.

Uxmal
Yucatan, Mexico

Izamal
Quintana Roo, Mexico

Good for age: 18+

Ek Balam
Temozon, Yucatan, Mexico
Experience
With its eerie masks and a lush, wildlife-filled rainforest setting, this Mayan city dating back to AD 700 is well worth going out of your way for; and youâll have the ruins pretty much to yourself at any time of day.
Good for age: 18+

Cenote Azul
Puerto Aventuras, Quintana Roo, Mexico
Experience
This big, open swimming hole â set in low jungle and filled with fish is safe enough for small kids, has changing rooms, life jackets and water-entry platforms. Itâs easy to reach, sitting right off the main CancÃºn-Chetumal highway 15 minutesâ drive from Playa.

A big restaurant, a tequila museum and a tour bus car park: this big, open-air pool near Chichen Itza is hugely popular but empty at the beginning and end of the day.
Good for age: 8+

Cenote Sac Actun
Tulum, Quintana Roo, Mexico
Experience
One of a string of less-visited cenotes lying close to more celebrated Dos Ojos, Sac Actun sits in a dramatic cavern filled with stalactites and illuminated by a single hole in the roof. Itâs on the Tulum-tour radar but arrive before 10am and youâll have it to yourself.
Good for age: 8+

Cenote Tak Be Ha
Tulum, Quintana Roo, Mexico
Experience
Turquoise-blue, set in a low cavern covered with small stalactites and illuminated by soft light through roof holes, this cenote is a beauty. Its remote location at the end of a long dirt road between Tulum and Akumal keeps it fairly crowd-free.
Good for age: 8+

Cenote Aktun Ha
Tulum, Quintana Roo, Mexico
Experience
This large, lily-covered pool filled with wispy water weed, terrapins, fish, and the occasional small crocodile, has water as clear as air. Itâs easy to visit from Tulum, yet itâs far less busy than nearby Gran Cenote.
Good for age: 8+

Cancun Museum of Underwater Art
Isla Mujeres, Quintana Roo, Mexico
Experience
British artist Jason Decaires Taylorâs underwater art gallery feels like a latter-day Atlantis â with statues covered with wispy seaweeds and baby coral, fish swimming all around sitting on the sand in vodka-clear water off Isla Mujeres. Scuba diving tours are available for both certified and beginners, and you can snorkel too (great for kids 4 and up).
Adult price: Â£45

Good for age: 4+

Chankanaab Beach Adventure Park
Cozumel, Quintana Roo, Mexico
Experience
Visitors flock to this little park for one thing: swimming with dolphins. Itâs highly touristy and often overwhelmed with cruise passengers (cruise boats docking at Cozumel sell the dolphin encounter onboard), but thereâs no denying the pleasure of swimming with these endearing mammals â especially for children.
You can also swim with manatees and sea lions here, and the Chankanaab Reef, just offshore within the park, offers safe and accessible, if fairly mediocre snorkelling.
Adult price: Â£21
Good for age: 4+

Cenote Manati [snorkelling & scuba diving]
Tulum, Quintana Roo, Mexico
Experience
Not all cenotes are sink holes in the jungle. Manati (aka Casa Cenote) â tucked behind the long white sands of Tulum beach is the entrance to an underground river, which flows into a winding creek lined.
The cenote is named after the manatees which used to live here until tourism became overwhelming. There are plenty of fish though, including schools of large tarpon and a small Moreletâs crocodile called Panchito. And the water is glassy-clear â running from the creek into caverns fringed with a labyrinthine tangle of mangrove roots. Superb for snorkelling and novice divers.
Good for age: 8+

Snorkel on Cozumelâs Reefs
Cozumel, Quintana Roo, Mexico
Experience
Cozumelâs best snorkelling is a boat ride from the shore. Most dive shops organise designated snorkel trips or take snorkellers on dive excursions.
But choose trips carefully; many reefs are deep and currents can be strong â especially at the far south of the island.
Adult price: Â£50

El Camaleon Mayakoba Golf Course
Playa del Carmen, Quintana Roo, Mexico
Experience
The first course to host an official PGA Tour event outside of the United States or Canada, this tree-lined championship course was designed by Greg Norman and makes full use of its natural environment. Like the chameleon in the name, the course changes throughout its routing, weaving its way through dense jungle, mangrove forests and along beautiful stretches of white sand.
Its most distinctive hazards are the cenotes â natural sink holes â and water canals. Itâs still the host of the annual Mayakoba Classic â it was here, in 2018, that Matt Kuchar caused a stir when he paid a local caddie a measly $5,000 out of his $1.3m for winning the event. The caddie, David Giral âEl Toucanâ Ortiz, said he wasnât too upset, but they did later agree on a better fee.

Dubai
United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Destination guide
The city-state of Dubai is the most populous of the seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates (UAE), located on the south coast of the Arabian Gulf.
Yet itâs a total one-off; from audacious architecture and shiny mega-malls to busy Dubai Creek and its glittering gold souk, this cosmopolitan Arabian hub is a shrine to excess like no other. By day, itâs all about soaking up the sunshine on the cityâs many long, golden beaches and splashing in the turquoise sea.
After dark, youâll be losing yourself in the souks and haggling for carpets, feasting on Arabic food, and enjoying the balmy nightlife. Casual diners can snack on shawarma wraps and sip fresh mango juice, while luxe-loving jetsetters can savour degustation menus by internationally-renowned chefs, and drink cocktails at some of the worldâs best hotels.
By many standards Dubai is an exceptional place â when they do something here it’s usually either the biggest in the world, or a world first. Perhaps not surprising then that few, if any, cities can rival Dubai for a family holiday.
Hotels are exceptionally family-friendly, with plenty of bed and bedroom configurations, kids’ meals, space for play and facilities galore (including kids’ clubs). Then,Â there’s a prevalence of good weather, golden sand beaches and waterparks â a heady mix for any kid.
Even a trip to the shopping mall â usually an occasion of dread for the little nippers â can yield skiing, ice skating, giant aquariums, waterfalls, cinemas, oversized toy shops and more in Dubai’s mega shopping mallsÂ slash entertainment centres.
Last, but not least, there there are a ridiculous number of specialist family attractions and activities on offer. Here’s our round-up of some of the best.

Burj Khalifa
Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Bucket List Experience
At 828 metres, the Burj Khalifa is the worldâs tallest building â truly a sight to behold, whether standing proud against a clear blue desert sky, reflecting the colours of the sunset, or springing to life with lights and LED displays at night.
Gaze up at it from ground level or ride up to the 125th floor, in the lift with the longest travel distance in the world for the ‘At the Top’ experience. The towerâs observation decks offer multimedia presentations about Dubaiâs history, and immersive virtual reality experiences. You can even step out onto the worldâs highest outdoor observation deck, located on the 148th floor.
Adult price: Â£30
Good for age: 4+

Museum of the Future
Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Bucket List Experience
This extraordinary, one-of-a-kind museum offers visitors an insight into what a future world will look like. Interactive exhibits and displays showcase cutting-edge technologies like AI, robotics, and virtual reality that delight, amaze and bamboozle. The highlight of the museum is undoubtedly the Future Lab, where visitors can try out futuristic technologies and even create their own inventions. Kids of all ages will love it here.
Even if you don’t go inside, at least stop by to see the building â an architectural marvel with the metallic facade, smothered in intricate geometric patterns.
From Matt: Highlight for me was the lift you can take to the top floor when you start your visit. It simulates a spaceship launch up to a space station. Brilliant!

Dubai desert safaris
Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Bucket List Experience
Due to their often inaccessible locations, unrelenting heat and generally harsh living conditions, deserts are not something we come across or get the chance to experience often â which is why this is such an essential Dubai experience.
First, there are your desert outdoor activities for those with an interest in adrenaline. These include sandboarding, dune-bashing (driving over dunes in 4x4s) and quad biking. A number of more nature-themed safaris head instead to the Dubai Desert Conservation Reserve, a stunning environment populated with rehabilitated indigenous wildlife, including the once-endangered Arabian oryx and gazelle.
Second, a trip into the expansive desert outside of the city also allows you to tick off a checklist of distinctly Arabian experiences. Many tours will include the option to ride on a camel, watch a traditional falconry display, smoke a sheesha and get a henna tattoo.
Your Lawrence of Arabia desert experience concludes at a Bedouin-style desert camp for dinner, with entertainment supplied by traditional local performers, including belly dancers.
Platinum Heritage and Sonara Camp are amongst the best operators that have overnight camp options. You could then also arrange a sunrise hot air balloon flight â a surreally beautiful way to see the desert.
Some of the desert activities have minimum age requirements; for example, dune buggying is for over-14s only (passengers) or over-18s (drivers), camel riding for over 5s. The sunset dinner safaris are a great experience for children from about 5 upwards.
Adult price: Â£20+

A night in the desert
Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Bucket List Experience
Desert safaris â that include a checklist of outdoor desert adventures â are one of Dubai’s top attractions. But many miss out on the rare opportunity to spend a night in the desert. When the tour group hordes head back after their Beduin-style dinner, the desert returns to a place of utter tranquillity, overlooked by a carpet of twinkling stars for mesmerising star-gazing.
Luxury local operator Nara offers you the chance to stay a night, or two, at their ‘Nest’ camp. You can go straight there for sunset drinks, followed by dinner. Meals range from simple barbecues to multi-course feasts, with most evenings ending with glasses of steaming mint tea, taken around a flickering fire. Â You can try your hand at archery, or perhaps ride a camel, and learn some astronomy âÂ  the starry night sky is magnificent and clear.
Alternatively, you can choose to dine atÂ the Sonara Camp, where dinner is taken in a hollow carved out of the sands, strewn with fairy lights, with an open kitchen and a stage, where the eveningâs performances include a whirling dervish and fire show. Dishes infused with regional flavours include lamb shoulder with Ras el Hanout spices, slow-cooked hammour fish from Umm Al Quwain, and roasted cauliflower with tahini. Thereâs also an entire menu dedicated to vegan guests. Afterwards, you return to The Nets to sleep.
A more budget-conscious ‘desert glamping’ experience of offered by the Hatta Dome Park, where you sleep in specially-created dome tents, with views over the Hitta mountains. For the top-end experience, at a desert oasis no less, then book yourself in for a night or two at the uber-luxurious Al Maha Desert Resort & Spa.
All ages are welcome, but there are minimum ages for activities â for example, children must be 5 and over to ride a camel.

Dubaiâs best food & drink
Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Bucket List Experience
Emirati food is similar to other Arabic cuisines, with cardamom, saffron, turmeric, thyme and cinnamon as central flavours, but with the city home to almost 200 nationalities, youâll find a restaurant or cafÃ© serving dishes from almost anywhere in the world.
In recent years, Dubai has become a serious gastro-hub, with dozens of international celebrity chefs setting up outposts within the cityâs top hotels. However, for those looking for more affordable eats, there are excellent and more authentic Indian, Pakistani, Persian and Lebanese restaurants and cafes.
Harees is a classic Emirati dish to look out for, with small pieces of meat combined with cracked wheat and spices to form a kind of thick porridge. Shawarma chicken wraps are a delicious, omnipresent snack.
For the ultimate sweet treat, Loqaimat are deep-fried dough balls, best-served piping hot with a sprinkle of sesame seeds and a generous pour of date syrup.

Camel Racing at Al Marmoom
Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Bucket List Experience
Camels have always been an integral and essential part of Emirati life â for milk and meat, for transport, and for entertainment.
Like horse racing in other countries, camel racing is a hugely popular and traditional sport in Dubai â one dating back to the 7th century. Also like their equestrian peers, racing camels are big business. Prices start at $20,000 â the fastest can fetch bids over $2,000,000.
Dubai’s biggest camel racing track, Al Marmoom, located at the DubaiÂ Camel RacingÂ Club, is the best place to experience this lively tradition.
Races, with anything from 15-60 competing camels, last about 15 minutes, and range from 2.5 miles to 6 miles, depending on the weight, age and gender of the camels.
Thankfully, jockeys were banned in 2002 in UAE â the camels now spring in response to prompts from robot jockeys tied to their humps, with trainers following behind in 4x4s.
If you have time, and even if you’re not a typical fan of such sports, a visit to the track is well worth it for a fascinating insight into Emirati culture, tradition and rituals â Â and the unique and thrilling spectacle.

Deep Dive Dubai [scuba diving & snorkelling]
Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Bucket List Experience
With a depth of 60 metres, Deep Dive Dubai adds a new superlative to the cityâs attractions. Itâs the worldâs deepest diving pool.
But this is no ordinary pool. Themed like a post-apocalyptic sunken city, divers can explore a fully-furnished abandoned apartment, play arcade games, sit on a sofa, and shoot some pool, all underwater. Itâs a fun, underwater theme park and unlike any other diving facility anywhere in the world.
Donât worry if youâre not a diver â you can join a Discover Scuba session, or even just snorkel, to get a taste of the experience. Certified divers can explore the true depths, and there are a number of courses designed to help you improve your diving skills.
Children aged 6 and upwards can book in for a special ‘kids experience’ â choose between snorkelling, free diving or tankless scuba diving. If they’re over 10 they can also do a ‘Scuba Discovery’ dive up to 12m.

Helicopter flights over Dubai
Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Bucket List Experience
Some cities really lend themselves to being seen from the sky â and Dubai is one of them.
Hop in a helicopter for jaw-dropping flights over Dubaiâs famous landmarks, from Dubai Creek to the Burj Al Arab and the Burj Khalifa (the worldâs tallest building), and the man-made Palm Jumeirah and World Islands.
Flights range from a 12-minute short-hop, where youâll share the helicopter with up to five other people, to 45 and 60-minute private flights. If youâre also planning on visiting the Abu Dhabi, Ras Al Khaimah or Fujeirah emirates, you can book a VIP helicopter charter (and save yourself the drive).
It’s an unforgettable experience that gets you up close to Dubai’s world-famous landmarks, and puts the sprawling desert city in perspective. Children over 2 are permitted, accompanied by an adult, but kids under 12 may find the experience frightening.

Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Bucket List Experience
Floating over the Dubai desert at sunrise in a hot air balloon is a magical experience; the chance to get a unique perspective on just how extensive the desert really is.
As the sun rises and its rays touch the surface of the dunes, the colours change from pale yellow to orange, and in some parts where the iron content is high, almost scarlet.
If youâre lucky, you might have some early morning mist; as it clears, the extraordinary landscape of rolling dunes is revealed. Keen-eyed viewers may also see groups of camels traversing the sands.
Children over 4 are permitted, accompanied by an adult, but they need to be tall enough to see over the basket unaided â and unafraid of heights!

In a desert city where summer temperatures nudge 50Â°C, Dubai’s 60-plus shopping malls serve a similar function to city parks â vast open spaces where citizens can gather in comfort to wander and mingle, as well as to dine and shop.
The bigger malls also serve as entertainment hubs, with everything from cinema complexes and kids’ edutainment zones, to giant aquariums and regular live events. Even if youâre not a shopper, a visit to a mall is a quintessential Dubai experience â and one of the cityâs favourite pastimes.

Old Dubai [walking]
Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Bucket List Experience
The buildings of âOldâ Dubai may only date back 100 years or so, but this neighbourhood, encompassing the Al Fahidi heritage district, Bur Dubai and the Creek itself, is the place to come to get a feel of the cityâs history.
Until the 20th century, Dubai was a small pearl-diving and trading post, under the protection of the British as part of the Trucial States. Since the discovery of oil in the region, along with the formation of the UAE and independence in 1971, the city’s growth has been unprecedented, with mega-towers mushrooming out of the desert and tax-free zones drawing businesses and expatriates from across the globe.
From its roots as a centre of trade and pearling, Old Dubai is where you can catch a glimpse of how life would have felt before the skyscrapers arrived. Traditional wind towers rise up above the alleyways, old houses have been converted into atmospheric courtyard cafÃ©s and traditional wooden abra boats still cross Dubai Creek.
You can easily spend an entire day here, visiting some interesting museums, browsing the galleries, and shopping the souqs. Donât miss the opportunity to get on the water â cross from one side to the other for just AED 1, or book your own abra for a private hour-long tour.

Dubaiâs best beaches
Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Experience
While it may be famous for its desert location, Dubaiâs beaches are where residents head on weekends. The long coastline offers a choice of excellent public beaches, some with facilities including bathrooms, shops and food trucks, others without.
Options range from hip beach clubs or family-friendly public stretches of sand. If you stay at any of the luxury resorts along the coast youâll have recliners, cabanas and cocktail service to hand on a private stretch.
Head to one of the buzzy beach clubs and you can float in the warm waters or dance to the DJ. On weekends these can almost have the feel of outdoor nightclubs.
Good for age: 4+

Dubaiâs best shopping
Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Experience
With one of the worldâs most connected airports, serviced by one of the worldâs biggest airlines, Dubai has become an epicentre of global travel. Probably no wonder then that it has also emerged as one of the worldâs leading shopping destinations.
Extraordinary shopping malls â vast in scale and scope â are dotted all over the city. The big malls are destinations in themselves, mini-cities within the city, home to entertainment zones and hundreds of restaurants.
The most atmospheric places to shop though are the traditional souks (bazaars) in Deira and Bur Dubai on either side of Dubai Creek, (although the vendors can be extremely persistent at times).
Youâll also find concept stores in various locations, particularly around the Jumeirah neighbourhood, stocking products from local and regional designers, floaty kaftans, homeware and accessories.
Must-buy souvenirs include carpets, Arabian attars (perfumes), sheesha pipes, bronze coffee pots, Aladdin slippers, Bedouin jewellery, antique khanjar daggers, Gulf-style incense burners, dates, and fluffy toy camels for kids.

Queen Elizabeth 2 (QE2) heritage tours
Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Experience
The so-called ‘Golden Age of Travel’, spanning from the late 1800s to the 1950s, was a time when travelling by train, ship, or air was a luxurious and glamorous experience. Passengers dressed in their finest clothes and were pampered with exquisite cuisine and personalised service. It saw the emergence of iconic brands and travel experiences such as the Orient Express and the Titanic.
Saved from the tip, today it’s permanently moored in Dubai where it’s been repurposed as a hotel where guests can stay and relive their Golden Age fantasies. Guests and non-guests can join entertaining and informative heritage tours led by the shipâs former Cruise Director, which will teach you all about this legend of the seas and its role in the Golden Age.

Tokyo
Kanto, Japan
Destination guide
One of the worldâs busiest and most-populated cities, Japanâs capital can be quite a culture shock for first-timers. In places, itâs overrun with crowds, concrete and high-rise, yet youâll also find quiet neighbourhoods, sprawling parks, and traditional gardens.
Thereâs cutting-edge tech and ever-changing fashions, but also a fondness for the traditional ways that underpin society â youâll see that in the way people bow. Itâs become cliched to say Tokyo is where old meets new â but itâs true.
Here you can still (and must) experience the unique traditions of Japan: stay in a ryokan (a traditional inn), feast on a kaisheki-ryori dinner, partake in a traditional Japanese tea ceremony (regaled in a kimono), and perhaps, even, train to be a samurai (or a ninja).
And itâs absolutely true that Tokyo is one of the great culinary capitals â you could dine out on something different every night for a month and still have barely scratched the surface.

Cherry blossom viewing in Tokyo
Tokyo, Kanto, Japan
Bucket List Experience
Every spring Japan goes into sakura (cherry blossom) frenzy. The subject of everything from traditional haiku verse and woodblock prints to apps that track its flowering, sakura is deeply woven into Japanese culture.
Sakura are the blossoms of ornamental cherry trees â although found across Asia, Japan has historically been home to especially large varieties which were subsequently cultivated into todayâs impressive displays. Reflecting both its aesthetic and its importance to Japanese culture, cherry blossom became the national flower of Japan.
When the blossoms briefly reach peak bloom in late March or early April, nothing is as Japanese as heading out to enjoy a spot of hanami (cherry blossom viewing).

Sumo wrestling
Tokyo, Kanto, Japan
Bucket List Experience
Nothing quite says Japanese sport like large, semi-naked men trying to wrestle each other to the ground.
Sumo has been around for at least 1,000 years, initially performed to appease the Shinto gods before eventually becoming the major sport it is today. From the brief, yet hard-hitting bouts to the Shinto-influenced pomp that surrounds them, itâs a brilliant spectacle – and Tokyoâs Ryogoku neighbourhood is the centre of it all.
There are three 15-day sumo tournaments a year at the Kokugikan arena in Ryogoku, but if you miss those you could take a morning tour to one of the sumo training stables to watch the rikishi (wrestlers) go through gruelling practice routines.
Any time of year, Ryogoku is also worth a night-time visit for a chanko nabe dinner. This protein-heavy hotpot of fish, meat, vegetables, and tofu, is what rikishi eat to stay supersized.

Sensoji Temple
Tokyo, Kanto, Japan
Bucket List Experience
First built in the 600s to house a statue of Kannon said to have been fished out of the nearby Sumida River by two brothers.
Today, Sensoji in Asakusa is one of Tokyoâs most important and liveliest temples, dedicated to the Bodhisattva of compassion.
Itâs also its oldest and most visited â itâs one of the worldâs most widely visited spiritual sites with an estimated 30 million visitors a year.
The stall-lined approach is a bit touristy, but if you had time for just one temple in Tokyo, the giant gateways, five-storied pagoda, and vast main hall here make Sensoji the best choice.
Look out for the Kaminarimon (Thunder Gate), the templeâs outer gate, as you go in.

A day in Hakone [& Mount Fuji]
Hakone, Kanto, Japan
Bucket List Experience
As overnight trips from Tokyo go, itâs hard to beat the mountainous Hakone region â under 90 minutes west of the city centre by train.
A trip here takes you close to iconic Mount Fuji, at 3,776 metres Japanâs tallest peak. Add in boat trips with Fuji views on Lake Ashi, superb art at the Hakone Open-Air Museum, cable car trips to the volcanic Owakudani Valley, and more onsen (natural hot springs) baths that you could dip a toe into, and there’s plenty to please even the most discerning visitor.
The area is also home to dozens of ryokans (traditional Japanese inns) whereÂ guests stay in tatami mat rooms, are served multi-course kaiseki dinners and soak in in-house, private onsenÂ â classic traditional Japanese hospitality. If time allows, book into a ryokan for an overnight stay and get the full cultural experience.

Ride the Bullet Train, Tokyo
Tokyo, Kanto, Japan
Bucket List Experience
Whizzing around Japan at up to 320 km/h, Japanâs world-famous âbullet trainâ (shinkansen in Japanese) isnât just quick, convenient and incredibly punctual â a journey on one is a bucket list experience in and of itself.
From the regimented cleaning crews who whip through the train before boarding to make the carriages spotless, through to bowing conductors, itâs a very Japanese affair. Itâs very safe too; in 50 years, carrying over 10 billion passengers, there has not been a single injury.
With comfy reclining seats and, in most cases, regular trolley services selling snacks and drinks, itâs also very relaxing â especially if you watch Japan go by from the window while tucking into a bento and sake. Just as importantly, the Shinkansen can get you across large parts of Japanâs main island, Honshu, but also connects to Kyushu out west and Hokkaido up north.
It connects Toyko, Kyoto, Osaka, Nagano and many other major cities. So if you are planning to visit multiple destinations on your trip, make the Shinkansen part of your itinerary.

A day in Kamakura
Kamakura, Kanto, Japan
Bucket List Experience
From 1185 to 1333, the small seaside city of Kamakura, an hour south of Tokyo, was the political centre of Japan. Nowadays, itâs a popular sightseeing area, dotted with historic temples and shrines that has had it likened to a mini-Kyoto.
Most famously that includes Kotoku-in Temple, home to an iconic 11.4-metre bronze statue of Buddha thatâs been wooing onlookers since 1252.
Getting to Kotoku-in Temple for the giant Buddha means taking the charmingly retro Enoden Line a few short stops from Kamakura to Hase â worth it for the rickety ride alone.

Meiji Jingu Shinto Shrine
Tokyo, Kanto, Japan
Bucket List Experience
On the opposite side of Harajuku to the colourful teen fashions of Takeshita-dori and swanky boutiques of Omotesando-dori, Meiji Jingu provides the ultimate contrast to the cityâs modern concrete jungle image.
Built in the 1920s to enshrine the Meiji Emperor and Empress, the Shinto shrine blends naturally into the 170 acres of lush forest that surround it.
An hour here is an opportunity to not just have a calm break from the hectic city, but to take in traditional shrine architecture and get a sense of how Shintoism is still important in modern-day Japan.
Whenever you visit, youâll see visitors praying at the main shrine and writing wishes on votive tablets before hanging them in the inner shrineâs courtyard.
You might see a traditional Shinto wedding procession too â Meiji Jingu attracts lots of tourists, but itâs still a fully functioning shrine.

Onsen in Japan
Japan
Bucket List Experience
Japan is a mountainous country, jam-packed with volcanoes â and where there are volcanoes, there are hot springs. The underground geothermal activity heats water, that rises to the surface creating warm (even boiling), mineral-rich pools of water â fantastic for bathing in, if the temperature is right.
It’s estimated that Japan has over 3,000 hot springs â known as onsen â across the country. Good for health, especially skin, relaxing and sociable, it’s not surprisingly, then, that over the centuries a soak in an onsen has become an integral part of Japanese life and culture.
Many naturally occurring onsen have been converted into indoor (noten-buro) or outdoor (roten-buro) pleasure baths. They can be public or private facilities and sometimes contained within your hotel or ryokan.
For the real deal, you need to get out of the major cities to the natural sources of water. Public hot baths in cities, known as sento, don’t quite hit the spot.

If a day of museum hopping is your idea of heaven, look no further than Ueno Park in northeastern Tokyo.
Home to the Tokyo National Museum and its unparalleled collection of Japanese art and artefacts, plus five other museums, there isnât a better concentration of cultural sites anywhere in the city.
With a boating pond, temple and other attractions, the park itself is a pleasant spot to linger.

Tokyoâs best food & drink
Tokyo, Kanto, Japan
Bucket List Experience
One of the worldâs great culinary capitals, Tokyo is often heralded for having more Michelin stars than any other city. But what really makes it special, is that from high-end sushi down to a humble bowl of ramen, thereâs so much to try and so much of it is superb.
Sushi epitomizes that best â you could spend several hundred pounds at the most exclusive restaurants or have a quality feed for under Â£10 at a budget chain.
Across Tokyoâs dining scene, certain traits shine through â the frequent focus on seasonality and culinary technique, and the deep respect for chefs.
Specialisation too â youâll find no end of shops that have perfected just a single dish, whether thatâs ramen, soba noodles, or sumo-sized hotpots.

Traditional Japanese tea ceremony in Tokyo
Tokyo, Kanto, Japan
Bucket List Experience
A classical expression of Japanese hospitality that can last for hours in its most elaborate form, the tea ceremony has been practised for centuries. Every aspect, from where the most important guest is seated to how the host wipes the utensils, has significance. Every movement is choreographed, and for kimono-dressed practitioners, the nuances take years to perfect.
Full versions (around 4 hours) are only for die-hards; shorter versions are available down to a mere 30 minutes, but the shorter it is, the less traditional. There are usually special options for children, and some will include sweet-making.
Even the shortest versions, though, are a great way to experience traditional Japanese culture and formality.

Tokyoâs best shopping

As the capital of a country where shopping counts as a legitimate hobby, Tokyo has all the retail bases covered.
When it comes to fashion, many boutiques and department stores carry imported goods, but to get a sense of local trends head to youthful fashion hubs like Harajuku or Shibuya.
Or take a shopping deep-dive into otaku culture in the Akihabara district â the place to pick up manga and anime-related goods, or gadgetry.
For something traditional, Japan produces superb crafts, such as Edo kiriko glassware, Wajima lacquerware and Bizen pottery.
And donât skip the slick urban complexes – Roppongi Hills and Tokyo Midtown were the forerunners, but from its design through to its stores, Ginza 6 epitomizes contemporary Japanese style.

Stay at a ryokan in Tokyo
Tokyo, Kanto, Japan
Bucket List Experience
To stay a night at one of Japanâs ryokan (traditional inns) is to immerse yourself in living history â the oldest hotel in the world is a ryokan, established in 705 and still going strong 51 generations later.
Ryokan can be modest or uber-luxurious, but there are defining traits.
Almost all have tatami mat rooms and futon beds, staff wearing traditional attire like kimono, and an air of calm and quiet. Many have in-house onsen baths, and serve traditional kaiseki-ryori dinners (if not the full 12-course extravaganza, then at least simpler multi-course dinner that focuses on local produce and specialities).
But it wonât be for everyone. Kids can find ryokan a bit dull â and the food challenging. The service, though often superb, can also be inflexible, with mealtimes locked into narrow windows and many mid-range and above ryokan not offering room-only stays. The best approach is to stay for just one night.

Kaiseki-ryori dinners in Tokyo
Tokyo, Kanto, Japan
Bucket List Experience
The succession of artistically presented dishes that comprise a kaiseki-ryori dinner has come to represent the pinnacle of Japanese cuisine.
Featuring anywhere up to 12 fixed courses that focus on in-season produce, kaiseki will include some familiar elements, with sashimi early in the dinner, delicate tempura later, and maybe a few mouthfuls of wagyu as a centrepiece. The rest, however, can be wonderfully indecipherable.
Being such an exalted cuisine, kaiseki dinners donât come cheap â expect to pay at least Â£100 a head. Or, go for lunch, when many restaurants offer taster sets at a fraction of the price.
Just reserve well ahead â even though Japan has plenty of kaiseki restaurants, they always book up quickly.
They are often served at ryokans (traditional Japanese inns). For a real flavour of traditional Japan, book in for a night at one, and tick off both bucket list experiences at once.

Samurai & Ninja history in Toyko
Tokyo, Kanto, Japan
Bucket List Experience
No Japanese period drama would be complete without an appearance from the nationâs most famous fighters â the samurai and the ninja. Equally famous around the world today, the two had very different roles in Japan.
The samurai began as feudal warriors and by the Edo era (1603-1868) were part of the ruling class. The ninja had more humble roots, often functioning as farmers while operating as highly skilled spies and assassins.
Samurai and ninja get varying treatment in modern Japan â the samurai and their code of ethics are held in high regard, while ninja experiences tend to be more on the kitschy side. Part of that perhaps comes down to social status, but also the lofty status of a katana, a samuraiâs sword, which are still painstakingly handcrafted by highly respected wordsmiths.
For visitors to Tokyo, there are several places you can see historic swords and samurai armour, and to learn how to hold a samurai sword or throw a ninjaâs shuriken.

Bonsai trees in Omiya
Saitama, Kanto, Japan
Experience
One of Japanâs most refined, traditional art forms, the growing of ornamental dwarf trees and the creation of miniature landscapes, aka bonsai, first came to Japan from China roughly 800 years ago.
Varied in appearance and symbolism, they represent the imperfection and struggle of nature. And tending to a bonsai can be a lifetimeâs pursuit.
For bonsai buffs, or to simply understand more about this fascinating tradition, a day trip north of Tokyo to the Omiya ‘Bonsai Village’ in the neighbouring city of Saitama is well worth adding to your itinerary. There are half a dozen nurseries there open to the public, as well as a dedicated bonsai museum â the Omiya Bonsai Art Museum.
Just take plenty of cash if you feel like buying one â the most expensive on record, reportedly close to 800 years old, sold for more than a million dollars, and itâs not uncommon to see prices at nurseries hit the 10,000-dollar mark.

The gardens are set out in what is called theÂ sukiyaÂ style â a pond inhabited by birds and with three small islands.
Itâs an excellent study in traditional landscaping, and because itâs off the tourist trail itâs a very peaceful spot to spend a quiet hour or two.

Some bars here specialize in cocktails, whiskey or craft beer, for others is a type of music or even a theme â try Deathmatch in Hell if you are a horror film fan or Bar Plastic Model to relive a 1980s childhood.
Other foreign-friendly, but not touristy bars to look out for are the gothic Albatross and English-speaking Ace.

Los Angeles
California, United States of America (USA)
Destination guide
It may be home to Hollywood and Beverly Hills, but the City of Angels is more than just a la-la land of celebrities and Real Housewives.
This vibrant metropolis manages to check all the cosmopolitan capital boxes, from a buzzy art scene to top-notch dining.
Of course, itâs not all metro-fabulous here, and LAâs near-perfect natural setting between ocean, mountains and desert is a dream for outdoor adventurers â and who couldnât love the weather?
But at the heart of it all is Hollywood, the economic wheel that keeps this celebrity drop-top rolling on.

Disneyland
Anaheim, California, United States of America (USA)
Bucket List Experience
Itâs smaller than Disney World, but Disneyland is no less magical. Located south of LA in Anaheim, it was the first of the Disney-branded theme parks to be built (the design was directed by Walt himself).
Nowadays, the vast complex includes Disneyland Park, the Disney California Adventure Park, the Downtown Disney dining and shopping district, and three hotels.
A must for any young LA visitor â and itâs pretty fun for adults too.

LAâs best food & drink
Los Angeles, California, United States of America (USA)
Bucket List Experience
While the city is a melting pot of cultures, with cuisines from all over the world, first-rate sushi and Mexican food dominate â and youâre just as likely to have an out-of-this-world dining experience at a strip mall sushi joint or taco truck as you are at a Michelin-starred restaurant or omakase bar.
Korean food is also excellent â be sure to try ox bone soup, seafood pancakes and first-rate bulgogi and bibimbap. Naturally, there are also plenty of great spots to grab a burger or hot dog, and tons of joints operate a mean grill.
The farm-to-table movement is also huge, with LA chefs having access to fresh fish straight from the Pacific Ocean and vegetables plucked from Californiaâs rich earth.
Wine lists are dominated by Californian vintages â Napa, Santa Barbara and even Malibu. Napaâs Cabernet Sauvignons and Pinot Noirs are famed the world over.

Hike up to the Hollywood Sign
Los Angeles, California, United States of America (USA)
Bucket List Experience
The Hollywood Sign has long been a powerful symbol for the global entertainment industry. At 14m high and 110m long, you canât miss it.
Installed back in 1923 as part of an advertising campaign for a suburban housing development called ‘Hollywoodland’, the sign initially fell into disrepair until a group of celebrities funded its restoration in 1978, minus the ‘land’.
Getting to the foot of the sign itself is no longer possible, thanks to tight security. The best option is therefore to hike the picturesque but little-known Hollyridge Trail up to the summit of Mount Lee, from where you can look down on the sign, just 100ft below where you stand.
You’re rewarded with exceptional views of Hollywood and the LA basin to the south, and the San Fernando Valley to the north.

The bustling, charismatic Santa Monica Beach has diversions for all ages, from surf shacks to beach volleyball courts, along a two-mile stretch of golden sand backed by shops, restaurants and bars. With mild surf, itâs a great place to swim â and to try some surfing.

Griffith Observatory
Los Angeles, California, United States of America (USA)
Bucket List Experience
There are many reasons to go to Griffith Park, and one of the main ones is to visit the magnificent Art Deco observatory, which sits high above the city near the Hollywood sign.
You donât even need to go inside to make the visit worthwhile â taking in the view over LAâs skyline and admiring the buildingâs impressive architecture (which youâll recognise from films such as La La Land and Rebel Without a Cause) is more than enough.
That being said, donât leave without going inside, where youâll find permanent exhibits exploring the cosmos, free public telescopes and an excellent planetarium.

Drive the Pacific Coast Highway to Malibu
Los Angeles, California, United States of America (USA)
Bucket List Experience
The Pacific Coast Highway â or PCH as locals lovingly refer to it â is a stunning stretch of coastal highway that runs along the ocean from Santa Monica right up to Malibu. To the left, youâll see surfers riding the waves; to the right are multimillion-dollar homes precariously perched on the cliffs.
Once you get to Malibu, take a stroll to the end of Malibu pier, where youâll find the Ranch at the Pier boutique. Run by local resident Alice Bamford (the daughter of British JCB billionaire Antony Bamford), this is the place to come to pick up surf gear and stylish knick-knacks. Also on the pier is Malibu Farm, a great spot for organic Cali-inspired dishes, or tuck into baskets of fried shrimp with the local bikers at Neptuneâs Net.
To avoid the crowds, head to some of the lesser-known, slightly more inaccessible beaches â Point Dume and Leo Carillo are some of the loveliest in the area and are both great spots for watching surfers and the sunset.
Also uncrowded and pristine, Malibu Lagoon State Beach is one of LAâs best stretches of sand â watch for whales and dolphins off-shore. Itâs also an estuary with a wetlands area, great for bird-watching with tide pools ripe for exploration. Thereâs excellent surfing here, including Surfrider Beach, one of LAâs most famous breaks.

Iceland
Iceland
Destination guide
For nature in the raw, nowhere on earth compares to Iceland. Pocked by volcanoes, rocked by tectonic forces and coated in vast ice sheets, this strange volcanic island offers a smorgasbord of wild, weird experiences.
In a single day, you could find yourself hiking onto a glacier, strolling across a black sand beach, delving into a frozen ice cave, descending into a petrified lava tube or chilling out in a geothermal lagoon under the flickering lights of the Northern Lights Aurora Borealis.
Iceland is a paradise for nature lovers and adventurous travellers: savour every second.

Blue Lagoon
Reykjavik, Iceland
Bucket List Experience
Icelandâs most popular â and photogenic â geothermal pool is surrounded by black lava fields and framed by the steaming towers of the Svartsengi geothermal plant. Itâs an otherworldly place that looks like something out of a science-fiction movie â and an essential experience to tick off your Icelandic bucket list.
Averaging 37â39Â°C, the steaming pools are actually a by-product from the power plant, but donât let that deter you. The waters are rich in minerals and silica, absorbed from the volcanic bedrock, a tonic for skin inflammation.
The psychedelic, blue-green water comes from naturally occurring algae which thrive in the balmy water.

See the Northern Lights in Iceland
Iceland
Bucket List Experience
Iceland, being in the so-called âAurora Beltâ, is one of the worldâs top places to see the Aurora Borealis, the multi-coloured meteorological phenomenon more commonly known as the Northern Lights.
These shimmering, shifting, ethereal displays of light are caused by charged ions striking the earthâs upper atmosphere. They can be many different colours: commonly green, but sometimes pink, blue, red or yellow. Seeing them dancing over Icelandâs volcanic topography is a once-in-a-lifetime experience and a bucket list must-see thatâs up there with the best.
Thereâs no specific best place to see them â they can appear anywhere where there are dark, clear skies and low levels of light pollution. You can even see them around Reykjavik, although the further you travel from the towns, the more intense the light show is likely to be.
For guaranteed sightings, itâs worth taking an organised tour with a professional aurora-hunting company, as they have access to detailed aurora forecasts, know the best spots and sometimes offer a second trip if you don’t manage to see the lights.
With a bit of luck, though, you may see the aurora as an unexpected bonus while youâre off on another Icelandic adventure â perhaps while exploring remote areas like Snaefellsnes Peninsula, the Westfjords or cruising on the Jokulsarlon lagoon. Hotel Ranga has a special in-house observatory. See the links in our recommendations below.

Icelandâs glaciers & ice caves [Hiking & snowmobiling]
Iceland
Bucket List Experience
Glaciers â vast sheets of permanently frozen ice â are remnants of the last Ice Age which have never melted â at least not yet. Sadly, due to climate change, many of them are now retreating at an alarming rate.
With more than 11% of its land surface covered, and over 269 named glaciers, Iceland is probably the best destination in the world to explore these wonders of nature. They are relatively easy to access here too, and served by plentiful, well-run tours for adventure enthusiasts.
There are many different ways to explore the ice: on a glacier walk, by snowmobile or via a scenic flight.
Hiking on a glacier is the best way to see the ice up close: using crampons and ice-poles, youâll trek out onto the glacier in the company of an experienced guide to see crevasses, seracs, ice caves and other formations.
Snowmobiling is a much more high-octane activity: wrapped up in polar-style suits, youâll race over the ice at surprisingly fast speeds. It takes time to master, but itâs hugely thrilling fun.
Iceland is also one of the best places to see ice caves. These magical subterranean spaces glint and dazzle with polar colours, while strange ice sculptures adorn the walls, floor and ceiling. Little wonder they’re often featured in Icelandic myths as the homes of trolls, elves and other creatures.
Some of them are actually rock caves that are coated with ice, but there are also pure ice caves (usually located inside glaciers). Some are semi-permanent, while others only exist for short spaces of time before the ice swallows them up again.
These can usually only be reached on a guided glacier hike; many glacier tours include a tour of one or more along the way.

Natural spas and hot springs in Iceland
Iceland
Bucket List Experience
Like many Nordic nations, Icelanders are obsessed with bathing in the great outdoors â only here, they have the advantage that many of their favourite swimming spots are as warm as a bath.
Iceland is littered with natural hot springs, or âhotpotsâ, a by-product of the violent volcanic activity thatâs continually roiling just beneath the islandâs rocky crust. Some, like the Blue Lagoon and Myvatn Nature Baths, are very well-known â but there are hundreds more âhot potsâ hidden away deep in the countryside or along the coast which are known only to locals.
Bathing in the hot, mineral-rich waters is said to be good for the body and the mind. The naturally warm waters are especially rich in sulphur and silicate minerals â believed to be beneficial to skin conditions like psoriasis.

Caving in lava tunnels
Iceland
Bucket List Experience
Volcanoes arenât just about the craters: sometimes, thereâs even more to see underground.
Iceland is one of the few places on the planet where itâs possible to venture down into âlava tubesâ. These tunnels of volcanic rock are formed around molten lava flows, usually close to eruption points. As the flows peter out, the rock surrounding them cools, leaving behind hollow tubes that can be 15m wide and hundreds of metres long.
Hiking into these subterranean structures is a seriously spooky experience: dark, cold and lined with peculiar rock formations, it feels like venturing into the lair of some gigantic, monstrous worm.
Most lava tubes can only be visited on a guided tour. Access is variable: some of the more accessible caves have walkways built into them, while others involve scrambling, sliding and uneven footing.

Whale-watching in Iceland
Iceland
Bucket List Experience
Icelandâs pristine waters are among the best places in the world to spot wild whales. Tour boats take you out into the North Atlantic to see these gentle giants as they pass Iceland on their annual northâsouth migration, especially the main feeding and breeding season from May to November.
Humpback and minke are the most commonly sighted, but with luck you might also see sei, fin and, very occasionally, blue whales. Humpbacks â the most curious and playful of all the whales, so the best for whale watching â congregate in the far northern fjord of Eyjafjord.
The town of Husavik is the main base for whale watching, although itâs also possible to take tours from nearby Akureyri. Tours from Reykjavik head to wildlife-filled Faxafloi Bay, where dolphins, porpoises and puffins are also regularly sighted.
The tours guarantee sightings (or you get a free trip) and itâs common to see the whales up close. If youâre really lucky, youâll be treated to a breach â an unforgettable display of whale acrobatics, in which the animals leap from the water before smashing back down in an explosion of spray.

Thingvellir National Park
Thingvellir National Park, Iceland
Bucket List Experience
40km from Reykjavik, this landscape of lake, lava and rock is a geological wonder. It sits astride the divide between the North American and European tectonic plates, and in many places youâll be able to see the geological stress at work in the form of steaming fissures, hot water spouts and cracks. If you feel up to it, you can even snorkel or dive down into the Silfra divide.
It also provided the backdrop for one of Icelandâs most important historical events. A thousand years ago, Icelanders gathered here to found the Althingi, the worldâs first democratically elected parliament. You can still see the Logberg (Law Rock), where the parliament gathered and the lawspeaker recounted the agreed rules.

Tour inside the Thrihnukagigur volcano
Hafnarfjordur, Iceland
Bucket List Experience
A once-in-a-lifetime experience: the chance to travel down inside a dormant volcano, the only place in the world that itâs possible to do so.
It combines a 3km hike (around 45 mins each way) and a cave tour: the volcano is accessed via an elevator that descends into the volcanoâs underground chambers. If youâre feeling flush, you can skip the hiking part with a helicopter trip.
The volcano hasnât erupted in the last 4,000 years, but itâs still an unnerving experience as you descend on the elevator into its inky depths, like descending into the Icelandic underworld. The main chamber is just over 120m deep: the molten magma that once filled it is thought to have drained away, leaving behind a cavernous, cathedral-like space.

Snaefellsnes Peninsula
Iceland
Bucket List Experience
Reaching out into the icy ocean from Icelandâs west coast, this rocky, remote 100km peninsula offers a wealth of wilderness adventures.
Itâs only a few hours’ drive from Reykjavik, but youâll feel like youâve reached the end of the earth here: with its deserted beaches, sheer cliffs, volcanic mountains and frozen lava flows, it offers an unforgettable snapshot of Icelandâs wild side.
Itâs also topped by the shining expanse of Snaefellsjokull, a great ice cap which Jules Verne namechecked in Journey to the Centre of the Earth. And if youâve always wanted to do a glacier walk, this is a fine location to do it.

Snowmobiling in Iceland
Iceland
Bucket List Experience
For the more adventurous-minded, racing across icy wilderness, surrounded by nothing but mountains and fresh powder, is a heart-in-the-mouth thrill.
Snowmobiles (also known as a skidoo) are surprisingly fast (you can hit speeds up to around 45mph/70kph), and they enable you to reach remote areas inaccessible on foot.
Vatnajokull is the best glacier for snowmobile adventures, with large expanses of ice and snow to race across, and several offshoot glaciers in addition to the main ice sheet. Its size means it can accommodate a number of different operators, all of who offer slightly different routes. Trips onto Vatnajokull can easily be arranged in Skaftafell and the surrounding areas.
Langjokull, the âLong Glacierâ, is another great place. Tour companies like Arctic Adventures combine a snowmobile trip with a visit to one of the glacierâs many ice caves.
Myrdalsjokull is a glacier on the south coast, often used for day trips from Reykjavik. Snaefellsjokull on the Snaefellsnes Peninsula also has tours.
If you want to see the infamous Eyjafjallajokull volcano up close (or at least as much as you can see of it, since itâs buried under ice), the easiest way to do it is by skidoo. South Adventure offers a couple of possible trips.

Geysir (& Gulfoss)
Iceland
Bucket List Experience
The granddaddy of all the worldâs geysers (and the one after which all others are named), Geysir is one of Icelandâs classic, must-see sights. Situated in the Haukadalur geothermal area, a maze of steaming hot springs and mineral pools, Geysir is arguably the most famous geyser on the planet, and everyone who visits Iceland wants to see it.
In fact, the site isnât one geyser, but several. The original âGreat Geysirâ is thought to have been active for around 800 years, but it waxes and wanes according to local volcanic activity; currently itâs going through a dormant phase.
However, nearby Strokkur blows its top like clockwork, shooting a steaming jet skywards every five to 10 minutes. On a good day, it blows up more than 30m, sending a spray of hot water over the crowds gathered below.
If you want to know more, The Geysir Centre has a geothermal area and multimedia museum that explains the science behind the spurt.

Hike the Laugavegur Trail
Icelandic Highlands, Iceland
Bucket List Experience
Landmannalaugar is a truly stunning region of glaciers, volcanoes, mountains and lava fields â and one of the finest places to hike in all of Iceland, if not the world.
Part of the Fjallabak Nature Reserve, itâs the official start point for the Laugavegur Trail, an epic 55km, 4-day hiking route that winds its way to the valley of Porsmork and an area of hot springs way up in the Icelandic highlands (the routeâs name literally means âhot spring roadâ).
There are six camping huts that you can stay in along the way, but youâll need to reserve a place several months in advance. Most of the huts also have space for tent camping, but wild camping is not permitted anywhere along the trail.

Ride Icelandic horses
Iceland
Bucket List Experience
Icelandic horses â smaller, shaggy-coated and with a distinctive gait known as the tolt â have been specially bred here since Viking times. Found nowhere else, these hardy beasts hold a special place in Icelandic life and culture.
Tour operators offer whole-day and half-day riding tours from stables close to Reykjavik, as well as longer excursions. If you like horses â and even if you donât â itâs a worthy excursion.

Godafoss
Iceland
Bucket List Experience
Slashing through the Bardardalur lava field, and clearly visible from the Ring Road, Godafoss (Waterfall of the Gods) is not just one of the most beautiful of Icelandâs waterfalls, itâs also one of the most historically important.
Here, it is said, is the site where Iceland officially became a Christian nation: way back in the year 1000, the lawspeaker of the Althingi parliament, Thorgeir, threw pagan idols into the thunderous waters of the falls, bringing Icelandâs pagan past to a dramatic end.
But even without the history, Godafoss is a glorious sight: a crescent-shaped cascade of water, roughly 30m across and 12m high.
A hiking trail winds its way around the falls and offers brilliant photo opportunities, and a less visited â and less crowded â viewpoint.

Icelandâs volcanoes
Iceland
Bucket List Experience
Nowhere on earth is it possible to see quite as many active volcanoes as Iceland. Often, theyâre literally under your feet.
At the junction of two tectonic plates, Iceland is one of the most volcanically active places on the planet. Evidence of the geothermal activity bubbling just beneath the surface is plentiful, from gushing geysers to hot water pools â but if you want to see a volcano up close, youâll probably need to lace on your hiking boots.
Several of the islandâs volcanoes can be visited on foot, while others are best seen from the air or by snowmobile. But donât expect big spews of lava and smoking craters: while volcanic eruptions happen all the time in Iceland (most recently at Fagradalsfjall), volcanic eruptions here tend to be so violent that the most active sites generally arenât safe to visit.

Cruise Jokulsarlon Glacial Lagoon
Iceland
Bucket List Experience
This glacial lagoon in southeast Iceland is a unique sight. Shimmering under the great ice cap of Vatnajokull, the lagoon is filled with icebergs, which glint in a rainbow of icy colours, from snow white to translucent blue.
Simply wandering around the lagoonâs edges is an experience in itself, but the best way to explore is to hop on a guided boat cruise. Steering through the enormous icebergs allows you to see them up close and appreciate their shape and colours. Around the mouth of the lagoon, look out for seals diving for fish.
The icebergs are shards of the nearby Breidamerkurjokull glacier, which cleave off into the lagoon, and are pushed towards the sea as the glacier moves down the valley. Itâs well worth walking down to the beach at the mouth of the Jokulsa river, where icebergs wash up onto the black volcanic sands. For obvious reasons, itâs dubbed Diamond Beach.
Unsurprisingly, Jokulsarlon is a favourite location for film crews: Lara Croft, Batman and James Bond are just a few of the big-name movies which have used it as a backdrop.

A weird world of glaciers, crevasses, aretes, canyons and volcanoes, it offers a wealth of activities from glacier walks to snowmobiling, hiking, wildlife spotting, ice climbing and sightseeing flights.

Dettifoss
Iceland
Bucket List Experience
Iceland isnât short on waterfalls, but precious few can match mighty Dettifoss for sheer, jaw-dropping power.
100m wide and 45m high, the falls handle about 400 cubic metres of water every second â the largest volume of any waterfall in Europe â creating a vast plume of spray that can be seen for miles around. Itâs quite a sight, and the sound as it echoes from the surrounding canyon walls can be utterly deafening.
When conditions are just right, youâll see double rainbows lighting up the falls. Film buffs might recognise it â itâs been used by many big-budget movies, including Ridley Scottâs Prometheus.

Diving & snorkelling in the Silfra Rift
Iceland
Bucket List Experience
The Silfra Rift running right through the middle of Thingvellir Lake is the tectonic boundary between the North American and Eurasian plates. The glacial meltwater is pure and crystal-clear, creating excellent visibility and emphasising the striking underwater scenery.
This is the only place in the world where you can dive between two tectonic plates and two continents â the rift between Eurasia and America. The water is never warmer than 4Â°C (youâll need to wear a drysuit) and the glacial meltwater is so clear, it makes some divers feel dizzy.
Family-friendly snorkelling trips are available in summer, so non-divers can go too, and it all takes place in the beautiful surrounds of the Thingvellir National Park.

New Zealand's South Island
South Islands, New Zealand
Destination guide
Remote, windswept and thinly populated, New Zealandâs South Island isnât the obvious candidate for international tourism celebrity.
But for many people who live in the post-industrial cities of Western Europe and North America, this place is a primordial playground where you can ski, snowboard, hike, kayak and bungee jump to your heartâs content. The only factories here are wineries, breweries and Queenstown â a place devoted entirely to carefree fun.
The fact that most Kiwis are terribly nice makes travelling here even more pleasant. Strip away the backpacker veneer, however, and youâll find a much more complex and intriguing destination coloured by compelling Maori culture.
And for nature and outdoor adventure, there are few places, if any, that can match it.

Bungy jump off the Kawarau Bridge
Queenstown, South Island, New Zealand
Bucket List Experience
Kawarau Bridge is where, in 1988, this whole crazy thing began, with the first commercial bungy jump pioneered by AJ Hackett.
Set in a small, pretty ravine, this 43m jump with a dip in the icy river provides an idyllic setting for your first bungy â and great views for spectators.
Those looking for a more extreme jump experience should book into either The Ledge or the Nevis, AJ Hackettâs other two locations.
If the thought of jumping off a high bridge (understandably) terrifies you, save face amongst friends by braving the Ledge Swing instead. This self-release swing pings you 400m out over Queensland. You can even do it at night. Or opt for the ‘Human Catapult‘, which shoots you 150m out into the Nevis Valley with a 3G force.
If you’re either a total adrenaline junkie, or just a bit crazy, you can sign up for combo packages that include a combination of some or all of the above.
Still a thrill, but without the gut-wrenching freefall drop, the 130m long zip line offers the chance to speed across the Kawarau River at 60km/hr, solo or in tandem. A great option for families and scaredy cats.
Modern bungy jumping was preceded by similar sports played by indigenous tribespeople in various locations around the world, including South America and the Pacific. Young men would test their metal against one another by climbing a wooden tower and leaping off with lengths of rattan tied to their ankles.

Destination guide
A compact, sexy, urban retreat, Copenhagen is arguably the most stylish, progressive and tastiest of all the Nordic capitals.
Copenhagen stands out on the cultural front. Spend afternoons gazing at Gothic churches, browsing ultra-modern design shops, or taking in a clutch of cutting-edge modern art and design museums, before spending long evenings in quiet cafÃ©s and laidback jazz clubs.

Once youâve seen the original 1,000-year-old Viking ships in the hall, board and explore exact replicas on the museum harbour. You can also meet the boatbuilder and see his tools, dress like a Viking, and write your name in Runic letters.

For drinks, beer is king but look beyond Carlsberg: craft breweries like Mikkeller and Friends and Norrebro Bryghus are picking up deserved accolades. Or wash things down with a shot of ice-cold caraway snaps, or in the colder months try glog, Scandinavian mulled wine.

San Francisco
California, United States of America (USA)
Destination guide
San Francisco often gets second billing to its celeb-filled sister down south, but the stunningly-pretty bayside city full of Victorian manses and fog-shrouded, steeply-sloping streets packs plenty of charm. What started as a boomtown during Gold Rush days has emerged as one of the US’s most vibrant and interesting metropolises.
From brand-name attractions (the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz) and artsy offerings (museums and galleries galore), to diverse neighbourhoods conveying their own hyper-local style â not to mention the innovative chefs fuelling (arguably) the State’s best culinary scene â it’s easy, as Tony Bennett croons, to leave your heart in San Francisco.

One great way to see and experience the Bridge is to hire a bike and cycle through the Presidio and over the Golden Gate Bridge for coffee or lunch in the quaint village of Sausalito.

A mile-and-a-half offshore in the San Francisco Bay, Alcatraz â or ‘The Rock’ as its residents affectionately dubbed it â was one of America’s highest-security prisons until it shut down in 1963 (the razor-sharp cliffs and frigid waters were enough to deter most escape plans).
Nowadays, visitors can hop on the ferry at Perry 33 and tour the accommodations once occupied by Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly. Luckily, overnight visitors are no longer accepted.

San Franciscoâs neighbourhoods
San Francisco, California, United States of America (USA)
Bucket List Experience
San Francisco is a collection of culturally and visually distinct, fiercely independent, neighbourhoods â and they are undoubtedly the city’s greatest attractions.
Despite its relatively small size (just under 47 square miles), SF manages to pack in 36 ‘official’ neighbourhoods (though on many people’s reckoning, there are more than that), meaning you’ll enjoy a unique and rich cultural journey by default as you explore this beautiful city.

San Francisco, California, United States of America (USA)
Bucket List Experience
With seven floors and more than 33,000 works of modern and contemporary art, including design, photography, and media arts, the SF MoMA boasts one of the largest holdings of 20th- and 21st-century works on the planet.
The Mario Botta-designed building is a sight in itself, but inside youâll find Picassos and Pollocks galore, as well as works by Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, Andy Warholâs self-portraits, and photography by Ansel Adams. Also look out for artwork by abstract painter Mark Rothko, and master of 20th Century Realism, Edward Hopper, as well as the 30-foot-tall Living Wall made up of over 19,000 plants.
The museumâs store features everything from sunburst clocks to Warhol ‘Soup Can’ skateboards, and a gourmet cafe serves up tasty seasonal eats.

San Francisco, California, United States of America (USA)

Suitable for all levels and ages, sailing here is a tranquil, sometimes exciting, means to soak up the views and take in the panoramic beauty of this extraordinary bay city.
If you have more time, there are sailing courses available too, designed to teach ‘you the ropes’ (pun intended). What better place to learn to sail?

Cycle over the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito

To really appreciate the splendour of the Golden Gate Bridge, hire a bike and cycle across the Bridge to Sausalito, a charming small town and artist colony full of cutesy cafÃ©s and boutiques, and a number of art galleries.
This compact bayside hamlet marks the perfect end (or halfway point) to a bike ride. Stop for lunch or afternoon tea, with views back across the bay to the city. Then cycle or take the ferry back.
Even if you don’t fancy the eight-mile cycle ride there, catch ferries both ways. Itâs still a lovely place for a cycle and a spot of lunch, including the boat trip across the harbour past Alcatraz. You can also hire electric bikes which reduce the effort needed (notably on hills).

World-class art in San Francisco
San Francisco, California, United States of America (USA)
Bucket List Experience
From its myriad of art museums to its on-the-rise-again street art, thereâs no shortage of stand-out artwork in San Francisco.
Nearly everything about the city has an artistic edge. Thereâs the exquisite Art Deco beauty of the Golden Gate Bridge, and the colourful heart sculptures â which debuted in 2004 â that still dot the streets in spots like the Lyon Street Steps and SOMAâs Moscone Center.
The city is home to several world-class art museums, including the Museum of Modern Art and the De Young Museum for fine art.

Golden Gate Park [walking & cycling]
San Francisco, California, United States of America (USA)
Bucket List Experience
First of all: the Golden Gate Park is not adjacent to the Golden Gate Bridge. Rather, this rectangular, 1017-acre urban park lies on the cityâs west side â San Franciscoâs equivalent of Central Park but 20% bigger.
It’s home to some pretty stellar attractions, among them the world-class DeYoung Art Museum, the California Academy of Sciences, the Japanese Tea Garden, and the Conservatory of Flowers â not to mention acre upon acre of green goodness.
You can hire bikes or rollerskates to explore, and rowboats or waterbikes from the boathouse on the northwest side to float on Stow Lake, one of the parkâs loveliest spots.

Giant redwoods at Muir Woods [hiking]
San Francisco, California, United States of America (USA)
Bucket List Experience
Part of Californiaâs 82,116 acre Golden Gate National Recreation Area (which also includes Alcatraz and San Franciscoâs Presidio), 558-acre Muir Woods is a forest of towering old-growth Redwood trees, some more than 150 years old.
Named after John Muir, ‘Father of the National Parks’, this Endor-like landscape became the countryâs 10th national monument in 1908, and the first one to be created solely from land donated by an individual â in this case congressman William Kent.
Here you can stroll among giants in the forestâs Cathedral and Bohemian groves, where you can actually reach out and touch some of these ancient behemoths.
Outstanding walking trails and hiking paths wind through the forest. Trails range from an easy 0.8-mile Main Trail that follows along the parkâs Redwood Creek (stroller and wheelchair accessible), to the Dipsea Trail, a strenuous 16.1 km out-and-back hike that climbs through redwood forest and offers sweeping views of the Pacific before descending onto its shores at Stinson Beach.
There’s plenty of wildlife too. Look out for black-tailed deer, bobcats and banana slugs.

San Franciscoâs best food & drink
San Francisco, California, United States of America (USA)
Bucket List Experience
Thanks to both the ocean and an abundance of farms on its doorstep, San Francisco is big on farm-to-table and sustainable cuisine. Green-leanings aside, culinary talent runs rampant in SF â in fact, the Bay Area is one of the three areas in the US that the Michelin Guide series rates.
A long-standing immigrant community from the East translates to some of the best Asian food outside Asia.

Ride a San Francisco cable car
San Francisco, California, United States of America (USA)
Bucket List Experience
San Francisco is a city famous for its hills â which even today can make navigating the city hard work. In the ‘good old days’ at the end of the 19th century, before the widescale adoption of the motor car, San Francisco had 23 cable car lines crisscrossing the city.
Sadly, most were decommissioned in favour of more modern transportation and just three now remain. Itâs the last manually operated cable car system in the world. Designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964, it carries both visitors and locals alike over some of the cityâs steepest hills while showcasing some of its most iconic views. A ride on one is a must for visitors.
Of its three remaining lines, the Powell-Mason line, which goes from Union Square, over Nob Hill and into Fishermanâs Wharf, is arguably the most picturesque. If you can, try scoring one of the cable carâs coveted standing spots on the outside for a quintessential San Francisco experience.

Outside it’s just as spectacular: the glass-and-steel building was designed by Renzo Piano, and has a 2.5-acre garden roof covered with 1.7 million native plants.

Together with SFâs Legion of Honor, which focuses more on ancient artworks, the two make up the largest public arts institution in the city.

Lombard Street
San Francisco, California, United States of America (USA)
Bucket List Experience
Marketers call Lombard the worldâs crookedest street. True or not, the block-long lane hits eight hairpin turns â built to slow people as they drive the steep-steep street â as it snakes down Russian Hill. Instead of driving it (and sitting in traffic), youâll have more fun walking it.

The building itself is a late 19th-century landmark that was completely renovated and restored in 2002. It still serves as a transportation centre for ferries to Oakland, Alameda, Sausalito, and Angel Island.
Its views overlooking the bay and out toward the SF-Oakland Bay Bridge are worth going for alone.
Good for age: 18+

Fishermanâs Wharf
San Francisco, California, United States of America (USA)
Bucket List Experience
Once, this historic hub was where Chinese and Italian fisherman made their living catching fish, crab, and oysters along the waterfront. Although still known for seafood, today the Wharf is predominantly the city’s prime tourist hub.
As well as the usual tourist fare of attractions like Madame Tussauds and the city’s Aquarium, it’s also home to the SS Jeremiah OâBrien Liberty Ship Memorial and Aquatic Park Cove, where Dolphin Club swimmers brave the bayâs frigid waters daily. A large colony of noisy sea lions famously beds down on Pier 39.
Many tours, including the one to Alcatraz, depart from here too. Even if you’re trying to avoid the crowds, you’ll likely end up here at some point.
Editor: Please note, it’s a horrible tourist trap. We’re only including it as ‘bucket list’ as everyone feels they should go there as part of a visit.

San Sebastian
Basque Country, Spain
Destination guide
San Sebastian â also known as Donostia â has the charm of an elegant, aristocratic beach resort, mashed up with some of the best fine dining in the world. With 18 Michelin-starred restaurants in total â the most stars per square kilometre of anywhere outside of Kyoto â foodies come flocking from all over the globe to taste its boundary-pushing cuisine. There are hundreds of informal, laid-back bars, too, nearly all serving glorious pintxos (the Basque of tapas, skewered on toothpicks) late into the night.
The setting is pure enchantment: three beautiful beaches (including the enormous city centre La Concha and Zurriola, the Basque countryâs top surfing beach) framed by emerald mountains facing the rolling Atlantic. Itâs a gateway to the Basque Country, too â home to rolling green countryside, fishing villages, wineries and historic buildings so dramatically set that they were used in Game of Thrones.
San Sebastian is a city of great character, with an active, as well as an indulgent, side: try surfing, paddle a kayak or SUP to the pretty wooded islet of Santa Clara, or cycle the invigorating coastline.

Getaria Wine Region
Getaria, Basque Country, Spain
Bucket List Experience
If San Sebastian gets too intense, escape to this lovely village, just 18km west along the coast. Getaria is a real fishing port with a proud heritage. As well as an attractive medieval town centre, it has charming seafood restaurants and broad, clean beaches â and itâs still largely undiscovered by foreigners.
Getaria also has a burgeoning wine scene, as the light, sparkling txakoli wine is produced around here. Txakoli, a very dry, slightly sparkling white that goes perfectly with pintxos, is one of the new stars of Spainâs wine scene. Once just a drink that farmers made for themselves, itâs now ubiquitous in Basque bars and restaurants.
The original txakoli comes from the delightful hill country outside the picturesque village of Getaria, and itâs a great excuse to lose yourself in the areaâs countryside and sample a glass or two.

Founded in the 13th century, it was the traditional stronghold of Clan Mackenzie and their allies the Clan Macrae. Clan Mackenzie and Clan Macrae sided with the Jacobites in the unsuccessful Jacobite Rebellion, leading to the castleâs partial destruction in 1719 by British government forces during the rebellionâs repression. It was rebuilt from 1919-32 by Lieutenant-Colonel John Macrae-Gilstrap, and is now recognised as a Scottish icon.

Climb Ben Nevis
Fort William, Scotland, United Kingdom (UK)
Bucket List Experience
It might be known affectionately as âthe Benâ, but donât think a tramp up Ben Nevis, the highest mountain in the British Isles, is a walk in the park. Its summit, at over 4,400ft, can be clad in snow in summer, the weather changing in a second as you zigzag up the rocky Mountain Track. However, around 125,000 people make it each year and the sense of achievement â and the views â are second to none. âThe Benâ is the most challenging but rewarding Munro âto bagâ.
Go prepared though, it can be cold on the summit even if itâs sunny below so take a fleece and waterproofs. On sunny days beware of dehydration, wind and sunburn.

Scottish Highlandsâ best food & drink
Scotland, United Kingdom (UK)
Bucket List Experience
Contrary to cliched opinion, Scots donât live on haggis (offal, onion and oatmeal encased sausage-like in a sheepâs stomach), neeps (turnips) and tatties (potatoes) â or deep-fried Mars Bars.
More and more chefs are celebrating the local produce with inventive modern Scottish cuisine alongside a growing field-to-fork movement. It’s all about provenance and food miles these days and the Scottish Highlands’ rich natural larder fits perfectly with this ethos.
The hills are home to red deer (for wild venison), Highland âcoosâ (cows, for superb quality beef, notably Aberdeen Angus) and heather-grazed lamb; its rushing rivers and deep lochs are brimming with brown trout and salmon. Shellfish is another highlight from Loch Fyne oysters to hand-dived scallops off the west coast, rope-grown mussels, crab and crayfish.
The landscape is peppered with artisan smokehouses and charcuterie-makers, coffee roasters â and distilleries.
Once you’ve sampled the inventive tasting menus inspired by the fresh local produce what better way to end the evening than with a dram? The Highlands is whisky country and home to some of the most famous distilleries in the world such as Glenfiddich and the Glenlivet.

Bagging Munros
Scotland, United Kingdom (UK)
Bucket List Experience
Bagging a Munro sounds far more exciting than ‘climbing a mountain’ but that is essentially what it boils down to.
Munros are Scottish mountains over 3,000ft high, named after Sir Hugh Munro who first catalogued the peaks as ‘Munro’s Tables,’ in 1891. There are 282 munros in Scotland, the most famous, Ben Nevis, is the country’s highest peak at 4,411ft.
Bagging munros is a traditional Scottish activity, the ultimate goal to reach the summit of all 282. The first person to achieve this was A.E. Robertson in 1901 and since then over 6,000 ‘compleatists’ or Munroists have bagged them all.

Culloden Battlefield
Inverness, Scotland, United Kingdom (UK)
Bucket List Experience
Edward I of England first conquered Scotland in the 13th century, and for centuries to follow, Highland history revolved around the struggle for independence from the English, led by William Wallace, Robert the Bruce and Bonnie Prince Charlie, amongst others. Its legacy is a landscape littered with battlegrounds, grand castles, ruined crofts, and rich legend.
The bloody, hour-long Battle of Culloden in 1745 â the last pitched battle on British soil â saw the final defeat of the Jacobite rebellion to secure the House of Stuart to the British throne. The famous Clans were finally suppressed â even the wearing of the kilt was outlawed.
The state-of-the-art visitor centre brings that final battle to life â you listen to characters from the battle as you wander round the exhibition. Watch the battle immersion film that vividly projects the fighting onto the walls all around you, then step outside to tramp the actual battlefield with a guide.

Isle of Skye, Scotland, United Kingdom (UK)
Bucket List Experience
Skye is the largest of the Hebridean islands (48 miles by 25) â and the only one attached to the mainland by a handy bridge.
Despite the fairly remote location, there are plenty of reasons to make a beeline here. The raw grandeur of the landscape, dominated by the dramatic Cuillins range, draws munro-baggers, hikers, mountain bikers – and movie-makers; its credits include Macbeth and blockbuster fantasy, The BFG.
The Trotternish Peninsula in the islandâs north is home to some of the most striking landscapes in Scotland, easily accessible from the islandâs âcapitalâ, the wonderfully colourful village of Portree located on its eastern coast.
The Isle is also a place of pilgrimage for gourmet travellers schlepping to the Three Chimneys or Kinloch Lodge, the home of doyenne of Scottish cookbook writing, Lady Claire Macdonald.
And then there’s the history; Bonnie Prince Charlie famously fled over the sea to Skye after his defeat at the Battle of Culloden, and 13th-century Dunvegan Castle was the traditional seat of Clan MacLeod.

Fingalâs Cave
Inner Hebrides, Scotland, United Kingdom (UK)
Bucket List Experience
This eye-catching cathedral-like sea cave, rising 70m over the sea on the uninhabited island of Staffa, is made up of hexagonal columns of volcanic basalt that look as if they could have been moulded in a foundry. It’s a spectacular sight and a rare geological phenomenon.
It was formed by volcanic activity around 60 million years ago, when cooling lava fractured into these distinctive geometric shapes – at the same time and from the same lava flow as the Giantâs Causeway across the water in Northern Ireland.
The cave’s acoustics and the unique, cathedral-like structure have inspired artists and musicians, including composer Felix Mendelssohn. Visitors are drawn by its natural beauty, historical significance, and the chance to witness an extraordinary example of nature’s artistry.
Accessible only by boat, there’s a natural walkway that allows you to wander inside at low tide and experience the acoustics â the sound of waves crashing inside inspired the German composer Mendelssohn to write his Hebrides Overture.

Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park
Northern Territory, Australia
Destination guide
Uluru, the worldâs largest rock monolith, is synonymous with Outback Australia. Alongside the Sydney Opera House, it is perhaps Australiaâs most iconic sight.
But The Rock is at the centre of a living cultural landscape known as the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, a vast area of desert containing several other major draws â the domes of Kata Tjuta, Walpa Gorge and The Valley of the Winds. A few hours away, in neighbouring Watarrka National Park, is another extraordinary natural phenomenon â Kings Canyon.
Itâs the place to come to experience the Australian outback, Crocodile Dundee-style. As well as admiring the jaw-dropping geology, you can sleep out in swag bags, sample bush tucker, dine under a billion stars and spot kangaroos.
Now under the control of its traditional owners â the âAnanguâ â the park offers a unique opportunity to experience and learn about the planetâs oldest living culture â the indigenous Aboriginal people. The local Anangu people offer a variety of excellent tours and activities â from guided walks to didgeridoo lessons and dot painting workshops.

Uluru (Ayers Rock)
Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, Northern Territory, Australia
Bucket List Experience
Rising up from the silent desert floor like a gargantuan monolith, ochre-hued Uluru is one of the worldâs most bewitching sights â more so, as its colour and appearance constantly change depending on the season and time of day.
Formed more than 600 million years ago, and reaching a height of 348 metres, it overlooks wild and desolate desert landscapes, home for millennia to the Aboriginal people. The area is steeped in their legends and traditions; combined with the scenery, Uluru has an intense, unforgettable atmosphere. The thing has presence.
Climbing Uluru was banned in 2019, but there are still myriad ways to see and experience Australiaâs most sacred site. Walking trails encircle the rock allowing you to get close to see the many fissures, gorges and galleries in to the sandstone, some containing centuries-old rock art, whilst learning about its mysteries and legends from local Aboriginal guides.
Those looking for a speedier or less strenuous introduction can opt for a Segway tour or a camel tour. Meanwhile, helicopter and scenic flights are the best way to truly appreciate the scale and strangeness of this geological anomaly sticking out from miles of flat landscape.

Getting up close, you begin to see the complex and intricate beauty. Each part of the walk reveals something different; erosion has cut fissures, gorges and galleries into the sandstone, some containing centuries-old rock art, while some provide shelter for wallabies, possums or bats. Youâll even feel it â the thing has presence.

Kata Tjuta & the Valley of the Winds Walk
Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, Northern Territory, Australia
Bucket List Experience
After Uluru, Kata Tjuta (formerly known as the Olgas) is the second most visited place in Central Australia. This remarkable geological formation consists of 36 weathered domes dating back 500 million years. It is steeped in Aboriginal history and legend â there are many Dreamtime stories, notably the great snake king Wanambi, who is said to live on the summit of Kata Tjuá¹¯a. His breath was said to be able to transform a breeze into a hurricane in order to punish those who did evil deeds. Evildoers beware – he only comes down during the dry season, which is when you are likely to be visiting.
The only way to explore Kata Tjuta is on foot and there are several hiking trails available, including the famous Valley of the Winds â a 7.4km circular walk that takes around four hours to complete and passes by some spectacular viewpoints. The 2.6km Walpa Gorge Walk is one of the easiest to complete.
People staying at Yulara (around 50kms away) can book a guided walking tour, a sunrise tour or a scenic flight.

Kings Canyon
Watarrka National Park, Northern Territory, Australia
Bucket List Experience
The 100m-deep Kings Canyon gorge epitomises the raw desert beauty of Central Australia. A dramatic sandstone rock formation, formed more than 400 million years ago, it has a long indigenous history, stretching back some 20,000 years. Located in the protected Watarrka National Park, it is also home to more than 600 species of native wildlife.
Most visitors come here to hike. There are two main trails to choose from. The 6km Kings Canyon Rim Walk along the top of the canyon takes 3-4 hours and includes a stop at the âgarden of Edenâ waterhole. The shorter Kings Creek Walk is 2km (return) and takes about an hour, and tracks along the bottom of the gorge.
Other great ways to experience the area are camel rides, quad bike safaris and helicopter flights are also popular â as is dining under the stars.

Port Douglas
Queensland, Australia
Destination guide
Tropical North Queensland is a global eco-tourism hotspot, blessed with two of the worldâs greatest natural wonders: the Great Barrier Reef and the ancient rainforests of the World Heritage-listed Daintree National Park.
While most tourists looking to experience them head for backpacker-central Cairns, those looking for a more upscale, genteel base could no better than Port Douglas, Queenslandâs smartest beach destination. The swanky, cosmopolitan town is home to upscale restaurants and shops, spas, swish hotels and a yacht-filled marina, and has increasingly become both a culinary and wellness destination.
Itâs the ideal base from which to explore both reef and rainforest. It’s also a great place to experience and appreciate indigenous Aboriginal culture. The local Kuku Yalanji people have lived in the Daintree area for over 50,000 years and offer excellent and authentic guided forest walks, art classes and food gathering excursions.

Dive & snorkel on the Great Barrier Reef
Queensland, Australia
Bucket List Experience
This vast coral reef system, comprising almost 3,000 individual reefs and 900 islands, stretches for over 1,600 miles off Australiaâs eastern coast â itâs so vast it can be seen from outer space.
It supports an astonishingly rich biodiversity, including 30 species of whale and dolphin, 1,500 species of fish, 125 species of shark and ray, and six species of sea turtle.
Shark, Holmes and Osprey reefs regularly rank among the worldâs greatest dive spots. All three are accessible from Port Douglas on liveaboards â but theyâre too far away for day trips.
The majority of the reef’s treasures, though, are found just a couple of metres below the surface, meaning this magical underwater world is accessible to snorkellers and glass-bottomed boats as well as divers.

Daintree Rainforest & Cape Tribulation
Daintree Rainforest, Queensland, Australia
Bucket List Experience
At 180 million years old, this remarkable biodiversity hotspot is home to many ancient and primitive plant forms found nowhere else.
Its wildlife is extraordinarily diverse. Among the critters that call the Daintree home are 430 species of bird, 90% of Australiaâs bat and butterfly species, and over 12,000 different insects. The scenery is equally impressive â a landscape of rugged peaks and gorges, spectacular waterfalls, white sandy beaches, mangrove swamps and extensive vistas of pristine tropical forest.
To visit the Daintree to experience millions of years of natural history; the forest is a treasure trove of rare fauna and flora, much of it found nowhere else. David Attenborough called it âthe most extraordinary place on earth.â
Nearby is Cape Tribulation â where the Daintree meets the Great Barrier Reef. Aside from pristine sand beaches, itâs famed for being the spot where Captain Cook first âdiscoveredâ Australian in 1770, and where European settlers first arrived.

Aboriginal dot painting workshop
Mossman, Queensland, Australia
Experience
If the term âart galleryâ conjures up images of white rooms and hushed voices, then far north Queensland will blow your mind. The Daintree Rainforest offers a rare opportunity to connect to a rich indigenous artistic tradition â whether you take a painting workshop, explore some ancient rock art sites or listen to the Dreamtime stories that inspire indigenous painters today.
Nothing speaks âAboriginal artâ more than its world-renowned âdot paintingâ. The Aboriginal-owned Janbal Art Gallery in Mossman offers workshops that will teach you the craft, while explaining its role in the local culture with some engaging local storytelling. You can choose a canvas or a boomerang.
And if you donât like your own creation, you can pop into the art gallery proper and buy an expert, original piece after…

Kuku Yalanji Cultural Habitat Tours
Cooya Beach, Queensland, Australia
Bucket List Experience
The Kuku Yalanji have survived in this part of Queensland for over 50,000 years, developing a belief system that is inextricably tied to the natural world that surrounds them. Knowledge is passed down through the generations; an understanding developed over the centuries of the natural world and its annual cycles.
Gaining an insight into their culture and remarkable coastal lifestyle, gives a completely different perspective on the region.
To see the coastal lands through their eyes, join a traditional guardian from the Kuku Yalanji people for a morning of fishing, mud crabbing and spear throwing. The tours, which will appeal to adults and children alike, are led by brothers Linc and Brandon Walker, who will take you on a walk along the sands, mudflats and mangroves â stopping to teach you traditional skills such as fishing with a spear and how to find medicinal plants.
Along the way, your guides share stories passed down from their ancestors.

Dreamtime walks at Mossman Gorge
Mossman, Queensland, Australia
Bucket List Experience
With so much focus on the Great Barrier Reef, itâs understandable that the Daintree Rainforest gets second-billing. But a leisurely walk into the Mossman Gorge, with its astonishing range of plant and animal species, will instantly transform you into a rainforest aficionado.
A Dreamtime walk refers to the Aboriginal concept of âthe dreamingâ, when the natural world was created and shaped by mythical beings. The Daintree is one of the oldest eco-systems on the planet, dating back some 135 million years, and a walk with an indigenous guide beneath the towering strangler figs, fan palms and maple silkwoods is an unmissable experience.
The walk begins with a traditional âsmokingâ ceremony, designed to ward off evil spirits, before delving into the forest itself. En route, stories are shared of the Kuku Yalanji culture and traditions, and there is exclusive access to the tribal lands.
Alongside the Aboriginal history and culture, birdwatchers will be delighted to catch sight of pelicans, egrets, cormorants and the fearsome cassowary. It is possible to do a self-guided walk, but the rainforest is a different place when seen through the eyes of those who know and understand it.

Drift snorkelling on the Mossman River
Mossman, Queensland, Australia
Bucket List Experience
While adrenaline junkies might sneer at the idea of river snorkelling, there is nothing more exhilarating than drifting along under the jungle canopy of the Daintree Rainforest. The Mossman river carves its way through the etched sides of the Mossman Gorge, with sheer, rainforest-clad slopes rising up either side.
Along the way, swimmers will encounter an astonishing range of native animals â from turtles to water dragons and – if youâre really lucky – a platypus.
Whether paddling downriver or just drifting on an inflatable raft, river snorkelling is a delightful and very safe experience; the water in this part of the Mossman River is too cold for saltwater crocodiles. Drift snorkelling does not require any great athletic ability â just basic swimming skills and a taste for adventure.

Expect plenty of âoohsâ and âaahsâ during your cruise. Even for seasoned travellers, the first sight of the massive saltwater crocodiles (some of which top 20 feet) is jaw-dropping â and there is no shortage of these cold-blooded monsters on this river.
While crocodiles are the headline act here visitors will also see an impressive range of other native species, including frogs, butterflies and birds. Cassowaries, tree kangaroos, ringtail possums and kingfishers are some of the more exotic residents â but harder to spot. The boat captains offer a fascinating insight to the Daintree, its history and wildlife, and to local Aboriginal legends as you go.

Kyoto
Kansai, Japan
Destination guide
No longer Japanâs capital, but still very much the countryâs traditional heart, Kyoto wears its past with pride.
More than 1,000 years as Japanâs political, spiritual and cultural centre have left an incredible legacy of World Heritage temples, shrines and palaces.
Shop for traditional crafts, splurge on the most sublime Japanese cuisine, stroll in pristinely-manicured gardens and spend the night at a historic inn. You might even spot an enigmatic geisha or two. Kyoto is where old Japan still lives and breathes.

Cherry blossom in Kyoto
Kyoto, Kansai, Japan
Bucket List Experience
Every spring Japan goes into sakura (cherry blossom) frenzy. The subject of everything from traditional haiku verse and woodblock prints to apps that track its flowering, sakura is deeply woven into Japanese culture.
Sakura are the blossoms of ornamental cherry trees â although found across Asia, Japan has historically been home to especially large varieties which were subsequently cultivated into todayâs impressive displays. Reflecting both its aesthetic and its importance to Japanese culture, cherry blossom became the national flower of Japan.
When the blossoms briefly reach peak bloom in late March or early April, nothing is as Japanese as heading out to enjoy a spot of hanami (cherry blossom viewing). Whether you find blossoms in a park heaving with picnickers or a quiet stretch of petal-strewn riverbank, hanami is accessible to all. Just get a picnic sheet, a few drinks and something to snack on â then chill under the sakuraâs shade.

Geishas in Gion
Kyoto, Kansai, Japan
Bucket List Experience
Geishas (translation: artist) are female performance artists trained in dance, music, singing, conversation and hosting. Famous for their distinctive appearance â dressed in colourful kimonos, complimented by elaborate hairstyles and oshiroi make-up, theyâve been entertaining Japanâs wealthy and well-connected for centuries.
Kyotoâs historic Gion quarter, one of the worldâs best known geisha districts, is the place to see them. The world of geishas is exclusive and mysterious, but a walk around Gion gives fleeting glimpses into their lives and this remarkable, uniquely Japanese tradition.
The most famous of Gionâs streets, the flagstone-paved Hanami-koji, is a beautiful relic, lined with old wooden chaya (teahouses) where many geishas entertain. While chaya are off-limits without an invitation, you can stroll Gion in the early evening and spot geisha heading to work in their finest kimonos.
Also stop by the Gion Corner Theatre for the nightly one-hour shows. Theyâre touristy but fun, and include geisha dancing, traditional music, flower arranging and more.

Kinkakuji Temple
Kyoto, Kansai, Japan
Bucket List Experience
First built in 1397 as a shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsuâs retirement villa, but then transformed into a Zen temple upon his death in 1408, no sight better highlights the former capitalâs glory than this gilded temple casting a shimmering reflection into its islet-studded pond.
Taking in the view while strolling Kinkakujiâs garden pathways is a timeless experience. So, despite having UNESCO World Heritage status, it can be a surprise to hear that the current structure only dates to 1955. Thatâs when Kinkakuji was rebuilt after being burnt down by a crazed monk in 1950.
Hats off to the artisans who painstakingly recreated it – itâs stunning

Kyotoâs must-see temples & shrines
Kyoto, Kansai, Japan
Bucket List Experience
You are born Shinto (Japanâs indigenous religion) but die Buddhist â or so one Japanese saying goes. While most Japanese wouldnât call themselves religious nor profess to have a faith, the traditions of both Buddhism, which came to Japan in the 6th century, and Shintoism, run deep in Japan.
Newborns are celebrated with a visit to a shrine for Shinto rites, death sees Buddhist ceremonies. Marriage could be a solemn Shinto affair or even a white wedding, with an English teacher moonlighting as a fake priest.
The most common religious encounter for travellers is a visit to a temple or shrine â Kyoto alone has a combined total of almost 2,000, Japan roughly 150,000 in all. The main difference between the two? Temples are Buddhist, shrines Shinto, and the latter are distinguishable by their often-red torii gateways.

Ride the Bullet Train, Kyoto
Kyoto, Kansai, Japan
Bucket List Experience
Whizzing around Japan at up to 320 km/h, Japanâs world-famous âbullet trainâ (shinkansen in Japanese) isnât just quick, convenient and incredibly punctual â a journey on one is a bucket list experience in and of itself.
From the regimented cleaning crews who whip through the train before boarding to make the carriages spotless, through to bowing conductors, itâs a very Japanese affair. Itâs very safe too; in 50 years, carrying over 10 billion passengers, there has not been a single injury.
With comfy reclining seats and, in most cases, regular trolley services selling snacks and drinks, itâs also very relaxing â especially if you watch Japan go by from the window while tucking into a bento and sake. Just as importantly, the Shinkansen can get you across large parts of Japanâs main island, Honshu, but also connects to Kyushu out west and Hokkaido up north.
It connects Toyko, Kyoto, Osaka, Nagano and many other major cities. So if you are planning to visit multiple destinations on your trip, make the Shinkansen part of your itinerary.

Fushimi Inari Shrine

A sprawling mountainside shrine complex with trails covered by thousands of vermillion-coloured torii gateways, Fushimi Inari has become one of Japanâs most photographed sites.
Founded in the 8th century, but with most of the spread-out buildings dating to the 1500s, the shrine is one of the most sacred in Japan. Itâs dedicated to Inari, the god of rice, sake and prosperity, and functions as the head of some 40,000 Inari sub-shrines nationwide.
Itâs a wonderfully eerie place to explore, and a pleasing way to soak up traditional culture while getting some fresh air and exercise.

Kaiseki-ryori dinners in Kyoto
Kyoto, Kansai, Japan
Bucket List Experience
The succession of artistically presented dishes that comprise a kaiseki-ryori dinner has come to represent the pinnacle of Japanese cuisine.
Featuring anywhere up to 12 fixed courses that focus on in-season produce, kaiseki will include some familiar elements, with sashimi early in the dinner, delicate tempura later, and maybe a few mouthfuls of wagyu as a centrepiece. The rest, however, can be wonderfully indecipherable.
Being such an exalted cuisine, kaiseki dinners donât come cheap â expect to pay at least Â£100 a head. Or, go for lunch, when many restaurants offer taster sets at a fraction of the price.
Just reserve well ahead â even though Japan has plenty of kaiseki restaurants, they always book up quickly.
They are often served at ryokans (traditional Japanese inns). For a real flavour of traditional Japan, book in for a night at one, and tick off both bucket list experiences at once.
Adult price: Â£100

Traditional Japanese tea ceremony in Kyoto
Kyoto, Kansai, Japan
Bucket List Experience
A classical expression of Japanese hospitality that can last for hours in its most elaborate form, the tea ceremony has been practised for centuries. Every aspect, from where the most important guest is seated to how the host wipes the utensils, has significance. Every movement is choreographed, and for kimono-dressed practitioners, the nuances take years to perfect.
Full versions (around 4 hours) are only for die-hards; shorter versions are available down to a mere 30 minutes, but the shorter it is, the less traditional. There are usually special options for children, and some will include sweet-making.
Even the shortest versions, though, are a great way to experience traditional Japanese culture and formality.

Stay at a ryokan in Kyoto
Kyoto, Kansai, Japan
Bucket List Experience
To stay a night at one of Japanâs ryokan (traditional inns) is to immerse yourself in living history â the oldest hotel in the world is a ryokan, established in 705 and still going strong 51 generations later.
Ryokan can be modest or uber-luxurious, but there are defining traits.
Almost all have tatami mat rooms and futon beds, staff wearing traditional attire like kimono, and an air of calm and quiet. Many have in-house onsen baths, and serve traditional kaiseki-ryori dinners (if not the full 12-course extravaganza, then at least simpler multi-course dinner that focuses on local produce and specialities).
But it wonât be for everyone. Kids can find ryokan a bit dull â and the food challenging. The service, though often superb, can also be inflexible, with mealtimes locked into narrow windows and many mid-range and above ryokan not offering room-only stays. The best approach is to stay for just one night.

Day trip to Nara
Nara, Kansai, Japan
Bucket List Experience
Japanâs first permanent capital, from 710 to 794, the city of Nara is calmer, greener and more historic than Kyoto, and it’s home to some of Japanâs finest historical sites.
UNESCO recognises eight locations making up the âHistoric Monuments of Ancient Naraâ World Heritage site, including 5 Buddhist temples, one palace, one Shinto shrine and primaeval forest. See the full list on Wikipedia.
Most people start at Todaiji, a temple built in 752 that houses a 15-metre-high bronze statue of Buddha, then walk through the leafy expanse of Nara Park to Kasuga Taisha. The stone lantern-lined approach to this shrine passes through ancient forest, before reaching a vivid red main building decorated with hundreds of bronze lanterns.
On the way, look out for the parkâs thousand or so wild-roaming deer. You can get close and even feed them.

Arashiyama Bamboo Grove
Kyoto, Kansai, Japan
Bucket List Experience
Walking through the towering bamboo grove of Arashiyama (aka Sagano Bamboo Forest) can be an almost meditative experience. The emerald canopy beautifully filters shafts of light. Leaves rustle and stalks creak. Even when selfie sticks are swaying in tandem with the bamboo, itâs otherworldly.
With the groveâs walkway being just 500 metres long, itâs also brief. To get more from the trip, stop by Tenryu-ji Temple for its gorgeous, landscaped garden and then check out the opulent Okochi Sanso Villa.Â  Built by a silent movie star, it features traditional architecture, garden teahouses and sweeping views over the city.

In 869, Yasaka Shrine held a festival to ward off an epidemic. Itâs now one of Japanâs biggest festivals, attracting millions to Kyoto every summer.
Although running through all of July, with numerous small events taking place, the most noteworthy parts of the festival for visitors are in the middle of the month, when there are daytime processions of giant floats and a lively street party atmosphere at night.
If you want to go all-in like a local, go in a yukata â lots of people wear these colourful cotton gowns to summer festivals and there are plenty of places to buy them in Kyoto.

Shodo calligraphy in Kyoto
Kyoto, Kansai, Japan
Bucket List Experience
First brought to Japan from China in the 5th century, shodo, âthe way of writingâ, is one of Japanâs oldest art forms. A spiritual or meditative practice as much as an aesthetic pursuit, it was commonly practiced by nobles and samurai, and today every school kid in the land will dip a bamboo brush into sumi ink to learn the basics.
From calligraphic scrolls in temples and on ryokan inn walls to the annual public calligraphy demonstration broadcast on TV when Japan announces its kanji (Japanese character) of the year, shodo is very much alive and kicking in modern Japan.
With workshops available in English, itâs something travellers can experience for themselves for an authentic experience of traditional Japan.

Housed in a renovated wooden brewery dating from 1909, the museumâs exhibits document the history of sake, its varieties and how itâs made. Better still, at the adjoining Sakekobo mini-brewery, visitors can see small-batch sake being brewed with traditional methods.

Cappadocia
Central Anatolia, Turkey
Destination guide
Cappadocia is a fantasy land where the soft rock has weathered into a profusion of arches, caverns and eye-popping protuberances that resemble gigantic mushrooms or massive meringues.
The locals have followed natureâs example, hollowing the volcanic stone into homes, barns, fresco-painted Byzantine-era churches, and even so-called underground cities, enormous warrens where whole communities once sheltered from raiding Saracens and Mongols.
Of particular appeal to the culturally curious and to walkers alike, Cappadocia has in recent years acquired a wealth of architecturally distinctive and delightful hotels.
The natural beauty and culture of this World Heritage Site can now be experienced in levels of comfort and sophistication not associated with Turkeyâs steppe interior.

Whirling Dervishes of Saruhan
Avanos, Central Anatolia, Turkey
Bucket List Experience
Saruhan Caravansaray is the nightly setting for the regionâs famed Whirling Dervish ceremony, a moving and extraordinary ritual expressive of Sufi mysticism, and dating back to the 12th century. Watch on as the sectâs white-clad initiates spin themselves into a trance state to the haunting accompaniment of drum, flute and chant.
Often mistaken for a dance, it is rather a meditation practice, a form of ritual whereby the dervishes aim to reach a state of karma by focusing only on God and the music. The spinning helps concentration, and it supposed to symbolise the planets orbiting the sun.
The surroundings, a restored 13th-century fortified inn set amidst Cappadocian steppelands, add to the atmosphere of the occasion.

Walk the Pigeon Valley
Goreme, Central Anatolia, Turkey
Bucket List Experience
Cappadociaâs signature walk is a fairly easy (barring one scramble section) 4km stroll through fantastical, magical landscapes.
Starting in either Goreme or Uchisar, the path takes you into a wooded chasm with natural arches and tunnels, and leads past rock-carved pigeon cotes, idyllic orchards and vegetable plots.

Mountain biking in Cappadocia [quad biking]
Central Anatolia, Turkey
Bucket List Experience
Cappadocia boasts some of the best single track â paths rather than vehicle tracks â mountain biking in the world. The super-soft but gritty volcanic stone makes for smooth riding, often steep but with plenty of traction, through landscapes that are both spectacular and varied, with the panoramic views from the open uplands giving way to amazing wooded canyons, caves and carved tunnels.
The network of tracks is extensive, with ascents and descents to suit every level. Many of the valleys are easily accessed from local centres like Goreme and Uchisar. In the high season, should the like of the Red and Rose Valleys get busy with walkers, there are plenty of lesser-known ones to escape to in the Meskendir and Gomeda Valleys.
Quad biking tours are also available and increasingly popular (if more destructive); these tend to be shorter, faster and limited in routes. To truly explore and connect with this remarkable landscape and its people, opt for the mountain bike.

Pottery in Avanos
Avanos, Central Anatolia, Turkey
Experience
The Cappadocian town of Avanos has for centuries â been renowned for its pottery â traditionally made by men. (Women traditionally make carpets). It’s thought the tradition started in Hittite times, 2000-1500 BC.
The town benefits from two major natural advantages for pottery-making. First, the oily and soft red clay soil collected from the Kizilimark River delta is ideal for pottery shaping.
Second, the local tufostone rock is easy to cut and shape into ceramic kilns for heating; it’s also an insulating stone, essential for achieving temperatures of between 950 and 1200 degrees Celsius to turn the clay into ceramic.
Third, the soft bedrock also allows potters to carve out studios; these semi-caves maintain a stable temperature across the varied seasons.
You’ll find studios hune into the rock at every turn, where you can watch the potters at work, and purchase some beautiful ceramics of exceptional quality.

St Petersburg
Northwestern Region, Russia
Destination guide
From Matt: despite Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, we’ve left Russian content up on our site. There’s no reason you can’t add Russia to your travel bucket list for future visits. The war, and Putin, won’t last forever, and then we hope you go back. There are many innocent Russian people whose livelihoods depend on tourism, suffering greatly too from the actions of this evil dictator and his cronies.
Peter the Greatâs exquisite maritime imperial capital has dazzled visitors since its founding in 1703; the cityâs wide boulevards, spectacular churches and glittering palaces forming a backdrop to 400 years of Russiaâs turbulent history.
Seismic events have left their mark on St Petersburg, most particularly the revolutions of 1917, which took place in the cityâs streets and squares, and World War II, in which the city survived a gruelling 900-day siege, resulting in the deaths of over one million of the inhabitants through starvation.
Originally designed as a ‘Window on the West’, St Petersburg continues to fulfil that role today. This most European of Russian cities has always been characterized by dynamic change and a restless energy that inspired Russian intellectuals and politicians throughout its existence, as it still does today.
Russiaâs vibrant cultural capital attracts creative minds of all kinds, and a programme of renovation in the city centre has seen world-class art galleries, restaurants and bars opening up, alongside super-stylish hotels.

State Hermitage Museum
St. Petersburg , Northwestern Region, Russia
Bucket List Experience
The second-largest art museum in the world, a visit to the State Hermitage is the ultimate must-do in St. Petersburg â a jaw-dropping, overwhelming exploration of human history, spread across six historic buildings on the shores of the Neva river.
Whatever your interest â Egyptian antiquities, French Renaissance Art, Russian military history â it is represented here, on a scale few other museums in the world can match.
Founded in 1764 by Catherine the Great as a court museum, the original Hermitage was built as a private gallery for the Empressâ vast art collection, adjoining the Winter Palace. Eighty years later, the Hermitage was reconstructed under Nicolas I and opened to the public in 1852. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the imperial collections became public property.
Locals (misleadingly) refer to the Hermitage as the âWinter Palaceâ, but this is just one in the complex of five buildings, which display more than three million items â still a fraction of the Hermitageâs full collection. One ticket gives you access to all five buildings, each of which houses very different parts of the collection.

Catherine Palace
St. Petersburg, Northwestern Region, Russia
Bucket List Experience
Built originally for Peter the Greatâs wife, Empress Catherine I in 1723, this extraordinary Baroque summer palace was later expanded upon by their daughter, Empress Elizabeth using the services of her favorite Italian architect, Bartolomeo Rastrelli.
Rastrelli designed the palaceâs showpieces, including the magnificent Marble Staircase, the Grand Ballroom, and the interior of the incomparable Amber Room, which houses the priceless amber panels gifted to Peter by Frederick William I of Prussia. The stunning, turquoise 1,200-foot palace facade features Rastrelliâs life-sized caryatids (stone carvings of female figures, used as pillars) and glittering domes of the Imperial chapel.
A showcase for the grandeur of Imperial Russia, and a fascinating insight into the gilded lives of the Tsars.

Russiaâs Tsars & their legacy
St Petersburg, Northwestern Region, Russia
Bucket List Experience
St. Petersburgâs history is also that of the Romanovs, the dynasty that ruled Russia from 1613 to 1917. For two centuries these lavish and colourful rulers left their indelible imprint on the city and its environs, beginning in 1613 with Peter the Great. His yearning for access to the Baltic Sea determined the cityâs strategic location at the mouth of the Neva River, and it was his fascination with Western Europe which gave the city its look and feel.
Peterâs daughter Elizabeth took a city made of stone and gilded it with gold. This expansive empress, famous for her 5,000 dresses, many lovers, and frequent bouts of religious guilt, commissioned Italian Bartolomeo Rastrelli to design some cityâs most iconic Baroque buildings, including the Hermitage, Smolny Cathedral, Peterhof, and the Catherine Palace.
Catherine, Elizabethâs successor, and those that came after her, maintained the cityâs place at the forefront of trade, creating a glittering social scene and cultural hub, until the downfall of Nicolas II at the hands of the Russian revolution in 1917.

St. Petersburg, Northwestern Region, Russia

Today, this extraordinary mix of palaces, landscaped gardens and glittering architecture outstrips even Versailles.
Highlights include the extravagant Baroque Catherine Palace, built by Empress Elizabeth with its famous Amber Room. The more restrained Alexander Palace was the primary residence of the last tsar, Nicholas II and his family, and their place of house arrest after the revolution. Recent restoration has updated the rooms inhabited by the last Imperial Family with their own furniture and possessions
Between them, amid the pristine sprawling gardens of Catherine Park and Alexander Park, Palladian buildings rise up between the trees and dozens of follies giving a glimpse of British, Italian and French architectural styles of the time.

Peterhof Palace
St. Petersburg, Northwestern Region, Russia
Bucket List Experience
The most spectacular of St. Petersburgâs suburban estates, Peterhof was founded by Peter I in 1701, who was determined to create a network of palaces and gardens to rival Versailles.
Lining the shores of the Gulf of Finland, the estate remained a favourite summer residence of the Tsars for centuries and offers an almost bewildering array of exhibitions, private rooms and historic collections dotted throughout the buildings.
The highlight of any visit here is, of course, the Grand Palace â the largest and most impressive building of 30 rooms. In front of the palace is the Grand Cascade, a series of 64 fountains, flowing into a semicircular pool containing the largest fountain called âSamsonâ. The Samson Fountain depicts the moment when Samson tears open the jaws of a lion, and represents Russia’s victory over Sweden in the Great Northern War.
The beautifully landscaped gardens also contain other historic buildings if you have the time to explore â including the palaces of Monplaisir and Marli, as a pavilion known as the ‘Hermitageâ.
Peterhof attracts millions of visitors each year, particularly from May to September when the famous fountains and Grand Cascade are in full operation. Visiting the gardens is free, but undertaking a guided tour of the palace buildings gives a fascinating insight into the lives of Russiaâs gilded emperors.

St Petersburgâs extraordinary cathedrals & churches
St Petersburg , Northwestern Region, Russia
Bucket List Experience
When Peter the Great inaugurated St Petersburg in 1703, it was the beginning of two centuries of building, which saw some of Europeâs most impressive churches and cathedrals rise up alongside the ornate palaces created for the Romanov dynasty.
Building churches and cathedrals had long been a way of gaining prestige since Russia was converted to Orthodoxy in 988 AD. Dukes from different areas competed with each other to see who could create the most extraordinary and beautiful church.
For Peter the Great, the challenge was even greater; to build churches and cathedrals that would become the most impressive in the world. Many were a product of the Baroque era, and have ornate frontages with onion bulb domes and facades in vivid colours; powder blue, rose-pink and yellow.
Throughout the Romanov era, increasingly ambitious churches were built, leaving the city with the legacy Peter the Great had wished for â a city with some the most extraordinary religious architecture in the world.

Faberge Museum
St. Petersburg , Northwestern Region, Russia
Bucket List Experience
First commissioned by Alexander III as an Easter present for his wife, the Empress Maria Feodorovna, Fabergeâs fabled Easter Eggs are synonymous with the grandeur of Imperial Russia. Each exquisite, bejewelled egg is created from gold, silver and precious stones, each opening to reveal a surprise â often gem-studded jewellery.
Peter Carl FabergÃ© famously kept a large mallet on his work table and had no qualms about smashing anything that was not absolutely perfect. This assiduous attention to detail makes the 52 surviving eggs almost priceless, fetching colossal sums when they come to auction.
The Museum brings together several of the more famous eggs â the Hen Egg, the Lilies-of-the-Valley Egg, the Fifteenth Anniversary Egg, and the Order of St. George Egg â together with other items from the legendary House of Faberge, which represent the zenith of the decorative arts in fin de siÃ¨cle Imperial Russia.

Smolny Cathedral
St. Petersburg , Northwestern Region, Russia
Bucket List Experience
The dazzling cupolas and sky-blue facade of Smolny Cathedral, rising up from its waterside location on the River Neva, are one of St. Petersburgâs most arresting sights. Commissioned by Peter the Greatâs daughter, Elizabeth, to assuage her frequent pangs of Catholic guilt, Smolny was designed by her favourite architect, the Italian Bartolomeo Rastrelli.
Arguably his most magnificent creation, Rastrelli designed a traditional, five-domed Russian cathedral, but embellished it with exquisite interiors, and a baroque facade in her favourite shade of turquoise.
Climb the 277 steps to take in the spectacular views from the cathedralâs bell tower, and if youâre visiting independently, time it when a service is taking place, to witness the full drama of a Russian orthodox service.

Before you can say âuber-hipâ, your favourite boutique, gallery or nightclub has shut, moved or reopened as something else.
Berlinâs reputation as a den of decadence is well deserved, but thereâs so much more to this cosmopolitan, history-laden capital. Youâll find some of the worldâs finest museums, sophisticated cuisine, inviting green spaces and an incredible tapestry of buildings historic and modern â testimony to a rich, tumultuous past.

Berlinâs Museum Island
Berlin, Germany
Bucket List Experience
Over the centuries, Berlin has amassed an impressive hoard of treasures, starting with the collections of culture-mad Friedrich the Great, followed by a succession of emperors â their royal curators and architects equipped with lavish budgets â and rounded off by the spoils of a globe-spanning German Empire.
Most are now conveniently housed on one small âMuseum Islandâ, a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site boasting five adjacent world-class museums, covering 6,000 years of cultural and art history. An essential stop on any Berlin itinerary.

Brandenburg Gate
Berlin, Germany
Bucket List Experience
This former city gate was rebuilt in the late 18th century as a triumphal arch for a rising Prussia.
The arch was commissioned by King Frederick William II of Prussia to symbolise a period of peace and prosperity in Berlin. The neoclassical design by Carl Gotthard Langhans was inspired by the Propylaea, the gateway to the Acropolis in Athens, and it built from 1788 to 1791. It stands as the entry to Unter den Linden, the boulevard of linden trees that formerly led directly to the city palace of the Prussian monarchs.
Now one of Germanyâs best-known landmarks, the Brandenburger Tor is laden with historical significance. Napoleon briefly stole the Quadriga, the horse-drawn chariot atop the gate, and it was here Reagan urged Gorbachev to tear down the Wall. Nowadays, the gate stands as the symbol of national unity after reunification.

World-class art in Berlin
Berlin, Germany
Bucket List Experience
Berlin is a world-class art destination, thanks to three primary, complimentary causes.
First, there was a hoard of masterpieces collected on the order of culture-mad Friedrich the Great, followed by a succession of emperors â their royal curators and architects equipped with lavish budgets. Second came the spoils collected from a globe-spanning German Empire, and third, a generous amount of public funding in recent years has established Berlinâs state-owned museums way up there on the worldâs A-list of art collections.
No less impressive is Berlinâs thriving contemporary art scene â the most fertile in Germany â with more than 600 private and commercial art galleries, showcasing a wealth of well-known, emerging and undiscovered talent.

Wall Museum â Checkpoint Charlie
Berlin, Germany
Bucket List Experience
With its grim border guards and ominous sign â âYou Are Now Leaving The American Sectorâ â Checkpoint Charlie put the world on edge when Allied and Soviet tanks faced off for a few nail-biting days in October 1961. It was the recognised crossing point for the infamous Berlin Wall, which symbolised more than anything else the West’s ‘Cold War’ with the Soviet Union from 1947-1991. For a small and fairly non-descript site, it has enormous historical significance that will lives long in the realms of history.
Today, a cramped but compelling museum there tells the history of the Wall and the rickety tunnels, home-made aircraft, reinforced cars and mini-subs people used to attempt escape to freedom from East Germany â efforts that more often than not ended in heartbreaking tragedy. There are some good documentary clips too.
For a couple of Euros you can pose with a mock guard at the replica border booth and get your passport stamped with a pre-1989 visa.

Operating from 1936 to 1945, Sachsenhausen was one of the most notorious Nazi concentration camps during World War II.

Sachsenhausen held political dissidents, Jehovah’s Witnesses, homosexuals, and other groups deemed undesirable by the Nazis. The prisoners endured harsh conditions, forced labor, medical experiments, and brutal treatment. The camp also housed execution facilities, gas chambers, and crematoria, where thousands of prisoners were systematically murdered.
Liberation came in April 1945 when the Soviet Army arrived. Today, Sachsenhausen stands as a memorial and museum, providing visitors with a sobering reminder of the atrocities committed during the Holocaust and the importance of learning from history.

Lapland
Finnish Lapland, Finland
Destination guide
Knowing itâs the home of Santa would normally be enough to get any kid (and maybe even some of us adults) excited about a holiday here, but Lapland is no one-trick playground.
One of Europeâs last great wilderness areas, Lapland is a vast panorama of lakes, moors and coniferous forest â an outdoor adventure paradise. Santa aside, visitors come for the snowy thrills: husky dog sledding, snowmobiling, ice fishing, ice skating, and ice slides. You can also learn to build igloos, sleep in igloos, (luxury ones if you donât fancy the real thing), and dine and sleep in restaurants and hotels made from ice.Â  Every bucket list winter activity is here, and more.
Donât discount summer though for excellent hiking, biking, fishing and even husky dog sledding – on wheels. The lack of urbanisation, with associated artificial lighting, also makes it one of the best places to see the Northern Lights at their glorious best.
Whenever you go, be sure to experience the local specialty: a smoke sauna, followed by a (freezing?) dip in a lake. (Warning: the kids may opt out of this one, especially if you follow strict Finnish tradition and take off all of your clothes).
Also look out for the colourful local Sami people, who still follow traditions dating back centuries, living a sustainable lifestyle in perfect harmony with this harsh environment and its wildlife.

Lapland, Finland
Bucket List Experience
The world’s greatest light show is Mother Nature’s own â the famous âAurora Borealisâ â or more commonly known as the âNorthern Lightsâ. Itâs an extraordinary natural spectacle, caused by shifts of magnetic energy in the ionosphere, and itâs magical to watch them dance across the heavens, ethereal shapes in shimmering colours forming and dissolving. No wonder seeing them features on so many travel bucket lists.
If you havenât already, see our round-up of great ways to see the Northern Lights that also explains why they happen, where and when youâre most likely to see them (NB the best viewings are spring and autumn).
Lapland is in the so-called âAurora Beltâ, where Northern Lights are at their most intense and colourful. Its vast wilderness is about as far from civilisation as you can get in mainland Europe, with star-studded, inky black skies â making it one of the best places in the world to see the Lights.
Still, thereâs no specific one best place or time to see this notoriously fickle phenomenon, so we always recommend pairing it with another experience as part of a broader holiday adventure.

Thereâs Santaâs office, where Santa sits in a plush red-and-white lair, chock full of decorative Christmas kitsch, as elves parade around and giddy young visitors cue up to meet the great man.
Thereâs an âelf schoolâ, offering 20-minute lessons in elf secrets and skills, an elf show performed 3-4 times per day, an elf workshop where kids can make a wooden Santa decoration, an ice sculpture gallery and a small train that takes kids through Santaâs house.
At the end, kids can leave their name in the adjacent post office to receive a Christmas letter from Santa. All the magic of Christmas is here…

Experience a Finnish Smoke Sauna
Lapland, Finland
Bucket List Experience
Finns have used saunas for centuries â for hygiene, warmth and community. The traditional ritual alternates between intense heat and icy cold plunges into nearby frozen lakes.
It sounds unpleasant, but if you heat up enough first, you donât feel the cold â only an exhilarating, full-body tingling and a deep physical, emotional and spiritual cleanse.
It’s best experienced in the tranquil Lapland wilderness, surrounded by forests and stars.
Good for age: 13+
Duration: 1-3 hours

Santa Claus Village
Rovaniemi, Finnish Lapland, Finland
Bucket List Experience
Not to be confused with SantaPark, the nearby âvillageâ just down the road is also home to a (smaller) Santa grotto and post office. It is, however, more of an activity centre.
You can sign up for the usual mix of winter activities: reindeer and husky sleigh rides, snowmobiling, cross-country skiing, swimming in ice holes, and so on â so plenty for older kids, not just the youngsters. Thereâs a reindeer farm and husky farm close by. In winter months, Snowman World â an icy playground within the village â has ice slides and ice skating.
For parents, Santa Claus Village hosts stores selling three of Finlandâs top design brands – Iittala, Arabia and Marimekko. Thereâs even an ice restaurant and ice bar for parental escapism.

Sami Museum
Inari, Finnish Lapland, Finland
Bucket List Experience
The SÃ¡mi are Laplandâs indigenous people â a colourful, nomadic people who for centuries have lived sustainably in Laplandâs unspoilt wilderness.

The Amazon
Amazon, Peru
Destination guide
The Amazon Basin covers an area half as big again as India and with as great a variety. And like the Himalayas or the Sahara, it is the landscapes which overwhelm â huge waterfalls tumbling off table-top mountains, black, coffee-with-milk and blue rivers so wide you cannot see the far bank, fragrant cloud forests covered in wispy moss. While the Amazon is fabulous for bird life, it is not a safari destination. Larger animals are almost impossible to see in the dense forests.
Visits vary enormously â from stays in jungle lodges as easy and comfortable as a Southeast Asian beach hotel, to full-on expeditions â depending on the hub location you choose. The Amazon is suitable for all ages and all levels of fitness, though in general, any visit will involve some adventurous activity â short hikes, swimming in rivers or lakes and sitting in launches â often on hard seats.

Cruise the River Amazon
Iquitos, Loreto Region, Peru
Bucket List Experience
Travel deep into the humid rainforest on a small expedition boat to explore the headwaters of the Peruvian Amazon, one of the most inaccessible areas on the planet.
Most expeditions start in Iquitos and take you to the wildlife-rich Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve, sailing along broad, muddy rivers, the bottle-green forest stretching in every direction, scarlet macaws flying overhead and occasionally, pink river dolphins swimming alongside the ship.
Expert guides lead forays ashore in search of three-toed sloths, howler and capuchin monkeys, while flat-bottomed skiffs take you along the skinny, snaking waterways of this flooded landscape to look for caiman, turtles and piranhas.
There are frequent encounters with indigenous tribes, offering a fascinating cultural insight. Kayaking, piranha fishing and swimming in freshwater river pools are all on offer.
An intrepid spirit is essential for these adventurous expeditions, which tend to attract a well-travelled crowd.
Adult price: Â£Varies
Good for age: 13+
Duration: 4 days +

Boat tours on the Amazon River
Amazon, Multiple countries
Bucket List Experience
Taking a boat tour on the Amazon or one of its larger tributaries â either on a day trip in fast launches or an overnight cruise on a classic double-decker wooden Amazonian river boat â is an unforgettable experience.
There are spectacular landscapes around the Amazon itself, with the most beautiful landscapes where it meets the Rio Negro in Manaus and the black and coffee-coloured waters flow side by side without mixing for kilometres. There are breathtaking sunsets over the river, and the extraordinary sight of thousands of birds returning to the forest to roost.
Smaller launches offer far greater access to the wild than large boats and cruise boats â as they can navigate the igapo (tributaries) and varzea (flooded forest), the oxbow lakes and the igarape creeks.
For the best experience book a jungle lodge as far away as possible from an Amazonian town or city and take boat trips from there. Day trips leaving from large settlements like Manaus, Iquitos or Puerto Maldonado donât take visitors far enough into the forest to give a true sense of the wild.
Adult price: Â£60
Good for age: 8+
Duration: 4-7 hours

Kayaking in the flooded forest
Amazon, Multiple countries
Bucket List Experience
There is more to the Amazon than the Amazon River itself. While the main river and its large tributaries offer spectacular scenery, the smaller tributaries and creeks (igarapes) are where you stand the best chance of seeing wildlife and local life.
In the wet season, the river rises up to eight metres â creating unique, flooded forest landscapes known as varzea (on brown rivers) or igapÃ³ (on black rivers), which link together in vast labyrinths â extending through lakes tributaries and swamps covered with huge Victoria waterlilies.
Paddling on a kayak or dugout canoe through the flooded forest is magical, particularly at the beginning and end of the day when the wildlife is most active. Motorboats are also available for the less energetic.
Adult price: Â£30
Good for age: 13+
Duration: 2-3 hours

Visit an Amazon village
Amazon, Multiple countries
Bucket List Experience
Forest-covered islands with monkeys and macaws calling from the trees, black and coffee-with-milk rivers so wide you canât see the far bank, floating villagesâ¦ the landscapes alone make a boat tour in the Brazilian Amazon a must-do. But the best tours show you much more than the lovely landscapes, they offer a window on the lives of people who live in harmony with the forest.
Through hands-on interaction, these tours show how indigenous and caboclo riverine people have hunted and harvested the Amazon without harming its biodiversity; cultivating manioc, brazil nuts, aÃ§ai and cocoa fruits.
They tell the story of rubber â invented by the Omagua people and briefly during the rubber boom, making Manaus City one of the worldâs wealthiest metropolises. And they show you basic survival skills, from how to find water in the forest (from hanging vines) to how to make a natural SOS call.
Adult price: Â£60
Good for age: 8+
Duration: 3-6 hours

The Anavilhanas Islands
Anavilhanas National Park, Amazonas, Brazil
Bucket List Experience
The Brazilian Anavilhanas is the largest river archipelago in the world â a beautiful labyrinth of forested islands, some fringed with white-sand beaches lapped by the jet-black waters of the Rio Negro.
Bubble-gum pink river dolphins play in the waters, caiman-crocodiles bask on the beaches and at sunset, when the light is a deep, rich gold, thousands of Amazon swifts descend to roost in the rainforest trees.
Good for age: 8+

Boi Bumba Festival
Tupinambarana, Amazonas, Brazil
Bucket List Experience
Imagine Rio Carnival in the middle of the Amazon rainforest: thatâs the Boi Bumba festival. This three-night dance and music festival takes place on remote Tupinamba island in the middle of the Brazilian stretch of the Amazon river.
Itâs a spectacular night-time pageant â with giant floats, hundreds of costumed dancers and thousands of revellers. Through music and dance, two rival performance troupes take it in turns to tell the story of Pai Francisco and his wife Mae Catarina â who steal and kill a prize bull from a rich landowner.
The landowner discovers this and threatens to retaliate unless they resurrect his animal by midnight; which they do, with help of a shaman, a priest and an Afro-Brazilian Pai Santo, all of whom invoke the spirit of Amazon fertility â the CunhÃ£-poranga, played by a beautiful young dancer.
Keep an eye out for Carimbo dancing â a sultry, dress-swirling, Afro-Amazonian swing that makes tango look tired and tame.

Naples
Campania, Italy

The city is renowned for its mouthwatering pizza, lively street markets, and vibrant street life.

Pompeii
Naples, Campania, Italy
Bucket List Experience
The eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79 famously smothered the thriving Roman town of Pompeii with molten lava and choking volcanic ash.
Today, you can stroll along Pompeiiâs streets and see the town as it was that day in extraordinarily vivid detail â right down to ruts in the roads caused by chariot wheels. Peer into perfectly preserved homes and shops, and wander round the Forum and Roman Baths.

Good for age: 13+
Duration: 2-4 hours

Herculaneum
Naples, Campania, Italy
Experience
Pompeii‘s less famous neighbour, the Roman city of Herculaneum, was also destroyed by the AD 79 AD eruption, buried under a thick layer of volcanic ash.
Only partially excavated (a large part of the ancient town still lies under modern Ercolano) it is much smaller but better preserved than Pompeii, and in many ways offers a more vivid glimpse into daily life in ancient Rome. You can see well-preserved buildings, intricate mosaics, and even carbonised wooden furniture.
It’s also far less busy than Pompeii â making it a more authentic and evocative experience.
Adult price: Â£12
Good for age: 18+

Authentic Neapolitan pizza
Naples, Campania, Italy
Experience
The pizza phenomenon began in 1889, when visiting Queen Margherita was baked a pizza in the colours of the Italian flag: red (tomatoes), white (mozzarella), and green (basil leaves).

Namibia
Namibia
Destination guide
Agoraphobes take note; Namibia is probably not for you. But if you love wildlife and wide-open spaces, pristine landscapes and towns in a time warp, then this quiet corner of southern Africa should be top of your list.
You wonât need more than a night in Windhoek, the capital city, and from there the country is your sandy seductive oyster: south to the ancient dunes of Sossusvlei, west to the quirky seaside town Swakopmund, or north to the game-rich plains of Etosha and verdant rivers of the Zambezi region.
Itâs wild, welcoming and one of the most affordable destinations in Africa.

Sand dunes of Sossusvlei
Namib-Naukluft National Park, Erongo Region, Namibia
Bucket List Experience
The ancient dunes of Sossusvlei are amongst the highest in the world. These towering mountains of shifting ochre sand attract adventurous travellers from the world over, keen to climb the dunes â notably the lofty heights of âBig Daddyâ or Dune 45.
Itâs worth the climb to admire the eye-watering views of this sandy sea stretching away to the Atlantic.
Good for age: 13+
Duration: 1-4 hours

Hot-air balloon flights over the Sossusvlei Dunes
Namib-Naukluft National Park, Erongo, Namibia
Bucket List Experience
There are few more enjoyable ways to soak up Namibia‘s serene landscapes than from the silence of a hot-air balloon. Coasting on the airwaves doesnât come cheap though, so if youâre going to splash out make sure the sceneryâs worth the splurge.
In Sossusvlei, home to the world’s most beautiful dunes, that means dawn take-offs that have you soaring over the ochre sands for an hour, before a gentle touchdown and Champagne breakfast on the sands of one of the worldâs oldest deserts.

Safari in Etosha National Park
Etosha National Park, Oshikoto Region, Namibia
Bucket List Experience
âThe Great White Place of Dry Waterâ is easily Namibiaâs most popular safari destination, and one of the finest game reserves in Africa. Established in 1907, the highlight of the 20,000 sq km park is its namesake: a vast pan that â according to legend â was formed by the tears of a grieving widow.
Heavy rains can briefly fill the pan, transforming it into a haven of birdlife, but throughout the year waterholes and springs along its fringes attract the 114 species of mammal that call the park home.
Camps and lodges will offer daily game drives – usually at dawn and sunset when the animals are more active, and the temperature more amenable. Some camps will also be built around to close to waterholes, which brings the game to you.
It’s Namibiaâs top safari destination and one of the best in Africa, good for both self-drive and guided safaris. A multi-day safari here is a must for any visit to Namibia.
Good for age: 8+
Duration: 2-3 days

Skeleton Coast National Park
Kunene Region, Namibia
Bucket List Experience
This deserted corner of north-western Namibia hides myriad charms beneath a faÃ§ade of sun-baked desolation. Running for 500-kilometres south from the border with Angola, the coastline is named for the metal ribs of ships that have fallen foul of this treacherous coast and its enveloping fog.
Today, these wrecks are but one of the sights worth discovering: from a handful of eco-minded lodges in the region, visitors can also encounter raucous seal colonies and spot unique desert-adapted wildlife including elephant, rhino, lion and hyena. But the highlight is, quite simply, the enigmatic landscape of lonely beaches and shifting sands.
Adult price: Â£200

Wildlife safaris in the Namib Desert
Swakopmund, Erongo Region, Namibia
Bucket List Experience
Stretching away from the town, is the glorious, sand-filled wilderness of the Namib desert. âNamibâ in the local dialect means âvast and emptyâ, and the visitorâs initial impression is one of dune-filled isolation. But there is life here, and fascinating wildlife tours offer the opportunity to go out and discover the incredible and unusual endemic wildlife that somehow manages to survive here.
Expert guides, driving 4WDs, will take you deep into the dunes to discover ancient rock formations, dune geckos and sidewinder snakes. As you go, theyâll explain the unique geology and ecology of this exceptional landscape.
Full-day tours will also include a visit to the famous âMoon Landscapeâ outside of Swakopmund, where you’ll encounter welwitschia mirabilis plants, famous for their long, strap-like leaves.

Walvis Bay [boating & kayaking]
Walvis Bay, Erongo Region, Namibia
Bucket List Experience
The region that earned its keep â and name â from whaling is now somewhat ironically better known for abundant wildlife and biodiversity than harpoons in the surprisingly rich waters offshore.
Boating and kayaking ecotours are top draw. Birdlife is prolific, and close-up encounters with pelicans, flamingos and petrels are all but assured.
The same goes for the ubiquitous Cape Fur seals, while dolphins, penguins and even sunfish are occasionally seen. Tours end with Champagne and a platter of fresh local oysters.

Designated a Ramsar âwetland of global importanceâ, the combination of dunes and lagoon is breathtaking, while the dramatic 4WD drive along the coast â with the chance to sight springbok and brown hyena â make this one of the Atlantic coastlineâs natural wonders.

Epupa Falls & Himba Tribes
Kunene , Namibia
Bucket List Experience
The remote far-northern regions of Namibia are not easy to access, but reward the tenacious traveller with enigmatic desert landscapes cut through by a splash of green on the banks of the Kunene River, the highlight of which is the Epupa Falls.
In the Herero language of northern Namibia, Epupa translates as âfalling waterâ, and the series of glittering cataracts that make up the Epupa Falls â as the Kunene River tumbles some 50-metres through a series of gorges â is certainly a highlight of this remote corner of the country. It’s no Victoria Falls, but what makes the falls a stand-out is their very presence in such a stark and arid landscape.
Lodges nearby can arrange activities on the river, from guided hikes and birding boat trips to seasonal river-rafting and kayaking trips in the high-water season between May and November.
Beyond the river, cultural excursions to meet the regionâs Himba people are a further highlight. Famed for their ochre body paint and semi-nomadic lifestyle, a visit to Himba villages offers a unique insight into an ancient way of life

Iguazu Falls
Iguazu Falls, Brazil
Destination guide
Nearly 3km wide and 80m high, and with enough water to fill 36 Olympic swimming pools every minute, the Iguazu Falls on the border of Brazil and Argentina, are one of the worldâs great natural wonders.
As are their rainforest surroundings – protected by two national parks covering over 2,200 sq km of sub-tropical Atlantic coastal rainforest and with some of the highest biodiversity on Earth.
Alongside the main attraction, thereâs plenty to do and see â from rainforest hikes to white-water rafting, and a string of gorgeous falls-side hotels and true rainforest retreats.

Iguazu Falls
Iguazu National Park, Argentina
Bucket List Experience
Recently voted one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World, the Iguazu Falls stretch for nearly 3km, emptying 46 million litres of water over an 80m drop every second.
Fringed by lush rainforest and often framed by rainbows rising from the mist, they are majestic â whether flowing in a single curtain â when the river is full or dropping over some 275 separate falls at low water.
The falls span the border between Argentina and Brazil and to see them in their full glory you should walk the extensive panoramic jungle trails on both sides and take one of the myriad adventure excursions on offer.
Good for age: 8+

Boat rides under the Iguazu Falls
Iguazu Falls National Park, Argentina
Bucket List Experience
These tours begin with a ride along a forest trail in an open-topped electric bus, followed by a half-kilometre walk through the jungle to the river bank. Visitors then climb into a large inflatable boat and ride right under the San Martin drop, close to the most intense part of the Iguazu Falls â the Devilâs Throat.
With regular troops of vehicles on the paths, the safari offers little chance of seeing wildlife. But getting this close to the waterfall is thrilling.
Adult price: Â£50

Duration: 90-120 mins

White-water rafting on the River Iguazu
Iguacu National Park, Parana, Brazil
Bucket List Experience
Thereâs edgier white-water rafting in Latin America, but you wonât find a more spectacular setting than Iguazu. And itâs not just the falls â where the rafting excursion begins. River descents run through the heart of the protected rainforest â so youâll see parrots and toucans all around, and if youâre very lucky a jaguar, healthy populations of which live in the jungles around the river.
Depending on the water flow, the rapids vary from 1.5 (easy) to 3.5 level (intermediate). They can go up to level IV or even V after very heavy rains in December and January, but tour operators seldom run trips under these conditions.
Adult price: Â£80
Min age 14
Good for age: 14+
Duration: 4+ hours

Rainforest walks around Iguazu Falls
Iguacu National Park, Parana, Brazil
Bucket List Experience
All visits to Iguazu, on both the Brazilian and Argentinean side, include walking rainforest trails that run around the top and base of the falls. However, there are always lots of other people on these.
To see more wildlife, hike or mountain bike one of the forest trails on the Brazilian side away from the waterfalls themselves. Very few tourists do this, the rainforest is pristine and you will see rare birds, monkeys and possibly ocelot or jaguars.
The best trail is the 9km-long Poco Preto Trail leading to a sinkhole and then the Iguacu River; organised hikes will include time kayaking on the water.
Adult price: Â£35
Good for age: 8+
Duration: 3 hours - full day

Dinner at the Belmond
Iguacu Falls National Park, Parana, Brazil
Experience
The best food in Iguacu is at the Belmond, but the top end international menu and wine list isnât the main reason for coming. The Belmond sits right next to the falls and by dining here you get to see them after the park closes, in the moonlight.
Adult price: Â£50

Falconry Center, Foz do Iguacu
Foz do Iguacu, Parana, Brazil

Adult price: Â£8
Good for age: 4+

Churrascaria Show
Foz do Iguacu, Parana, Brazil
Experience

Krong Siem Reap
Northwestern Region, Cambodia
Destination guide
Cambodiaâs most visited city is home to the spectacular Khmer temple city of Angkor Wat and dozens of other dazzling ruins buried deep within the jungle. But it’s no tourist honeypot â it’s charming and wonderfully atmospheric too.

Egypt
Egypt
Destination guide
With its unique tapestry of ancient history, culture, and natural wonders, Egypt is a country â and a bucket list destination â like no other. It’s a captivating land of mystical allure that unfolds like a living museum.
But if you’re interested in a trip that ticks off all the bucket list sights relating to the ancient Egyptians, you need to plan on (at least) three stops.
First Cairo, Egypt’s capital, home of the incredible Pyramids of Giza, and the astonishing new pyramids and tombs being constantly discovered in nearby Saqqara. The world-renowned Egyptian Museum here holds a treasure trove of ancient Egyptian artefacts, including those found in the tomb of the boy pharaoh Tutankhamun.
Second, 700km to the south is Luxor, home of the extraordinary tomb-filled valleys, and the colossal temples at Karnak.
Third, further south still, exotic Aswan, your staging point for visiting one of the world’s greatest ancient sites at Abu Simbel, the Temple of Ramasses II.
Cruises down the legendary Nile river, in the footsteps of the great pharaohs, will take in all the major stops. Most visitors will fly from Cairo to Luxor, then cruise to Aswan, but you can cruise all the way from Cairo. You can also cruise from Aswan to Abu Simbel across the beautiful and less-crowded Lake Nasser. Wherever you start from, it’s an unforgettable odyssey watching Egypt’s rich tapestry of history, culture, and timless landscapes slowly unfold.


Pyramids of Giza & the Sphinx
Cairo, Lower Egypt, Egypt
Bucket List Experience
The densely-crowded Egyptian city of Giza â on the West Bank of the Nile just outside of CairoÂ â welcomes millions of tourists every year to visit one of the world’s greatest archaeological sites.
The Giza Plateau, wedged between the city’s borders and the Western Desert, is a remarkable complex of gargantuan stone pyramids, several cemeteries, and a giant statue of a mythological sphinx â all dating back to 2,500 BC.
Good for age: 8+

Cruise the River Nile (Luxor to Aswan)
Upper Egypt, Egypt
Bucket List Experience
Until the late 19th century, travelling in Egypt meant taking a boat on the Nile, as the roads were bad and there were no hotels. A trip on the Nile is still a defining experience, revealing a tapestry of astonishing ancient monuments, beautiful papyrus-dotted river banks, and a landscape that has remained largely unchanged in 4,000 years.
Cruises usually include visits to the magnificent temples at Esna, Edfu and Kom Ombo. All cruises end in Aswan, with a visit to Temple of Isis at Philae and an optional excursion to the Temples of Abu Simbel (strongly recommended).
There is, of course, the luxury riverboat option. The Sanctuary MS Nile Adventurer, formerly owned by Abercrombie and Kent, is a 5-star ship with 32 luxurious cabins and excellent food on board.
You could alternatively opt for a cruise on a charismatic dahabiya (a local sailing ship with 4-10 cabins). They can moor in more places than the large cruise ships, visit smaller sights on the way and get you closer to the Nile.
For the most authentic (and cheapest) cruise, feluccas sail between Aswan and Edfu or Esna, just south of Luxor. These single-mast boats have no cabins, so passengers sleep on benches or on the shore.
Adult price: Â£800+
Good for age: 13+
Duration: 3-7 days

Temples of Abu Simbel
Aswan, Southern Upper Egypt Region, Egypt
Bucket List Experience
The two temples of Ramesses II at Abu Simbel are among the most impressive of all the worldâs surviving ancient monuments. It remains a testament to the power of the Egyptian empire at its height under Ramesses II, aka ‘Ramesses the Great’.
Cut into the rock above the Nile flood plain more than 3,000 years ago, fronted by four colossal statues of the pharaoh. His consort Nefertari and their children can be seen in smaller figures by his feet. Queen Nefertari was the first of Ramesses’ ‘Great Royal Wives’.
The temple remains an awe-inspiring sight, despite having been relocated in the 1960s above the newly created Lake Nasser. Itâs angled so that each 21 February and 21 October, the sun illuminated the gods in the innermost sanctuary. This happens a day later since its relocation, following construction of the Aswan Dam.
Adult price: Â£12
Good for age: 8+

Valley of the Kings
Luxor, Middle Egypt, Egypt
Bucket List Experience
Known to the ancients as the ‘Place of Truth’, the 62 known tombs in the remarkable Valley of the Kings belong to some of the greatest of Egyptâs pharaohs, including the famous tomb of Tutankhamun.
Pharaohs began building and decorating their tombs as soon as they came to the throne, and they were stuffed with all of their belongings after their death to accompany them into the afterlife. The treasures are long gone, stolen by tomb raiders, but the hieroglyphic-decorated ceilings and walls are no less impressive.
Tutankhamunâs tomb is actually one of the smallest. Discovered by British archaeologist Howard Carter in 1922, itâs the only tomb found with its treasure intact (on display in the Grand Egyptian Museum in Cairo).
Adult price: Â£8
Good for age: 13+

Karnak Temple
Luxor, Southern Upper Egypt Region, Egypt
Bucket List Experience
Karnak, or ancient Thebes, was Egyptâs foremost religious complex originally built in 2055 BC. Over the course of 1,500 years the site was continuously expanded by pharaohs, in tribute to the Theban gods; more than 80,000 workers toiled here during the reign of Ramesses II.
The most impressive sight in Karnak is the superbly preserved, 250,000sq m Temple of Amun, which boasts a magnificent hypostyle hall with 134 massive columns.
You need to visit Karnak twice â once in daylight, and once at night for the Sound & Light Show, and to see the temple lit up.
Adult price: Â£10
Good for age: 8+

Temple of Isis at Philae
Aswan, Upper Egypt, Egypt
Bucket List Experience
For thousands of years this temple has attracted pilgrims from along the Nile and around the Mediterranean. Begun by the Ptolemies in the 4th century BC, dedicated to the goddess and her husband, Osiris, it became one of the countryâs most sacred sites during Roman times.
The temple was relocated to a new island following the building of the Aswan Dam, but it remains one of the most beautiful Graeco-Roman temples in the world, with the most romantic setting of all.
Look out for crosses and an altar in the inner courts of the temple: after the cult of Isis was suppressed, the temple was converted into a Christian church.
Adult price: Â£13
Good for age: 13+

The Pyramids of Saqqara & Dahshur
Cairo, Cairo Governorate, Egypt
Bucket List Experience
Just 20 miles south of Cairo, the lesser-visited Dahshur and Saqqara (also spelt Sakkara) are home to some of the world’s best-preserved ancient sites. With far fewer crowds.
Dahshur is home to pyramids even older than those in Giza â the first ever pyramids built by the Egyptians. The most famous is the Bent Pyramid â so named because of its irregular pyramid shape â built between 2613 and 2589 BC byÂ King Sneferu.
It was followed by a second pyramid, The Red Pyramid, named after the red limestone used in its construction. The Red Pyramid is the 3rd largest in Egypt. The two biggest â Khufu and Khafre â were built at Giza by King Sneferu successor, his son Khufu.
Saqqara was the necropolis for the ancient city of Memphis, the first capital city of Egypt. The area is home to multiple smaller pyramids and a number of tombs of nobles and generals. The highlight here is the Step Pyramid of Djoser, built in around 2700 BC for Pharoah Djoser. It’s the oldest stone building in the world. Surrounding the Step Pyramid is an interesting funerary complex.
The city of Memphis itself is estimated to have been founded in 6000 BC. There’s not a lot left â just remnant ruins in an open-air museum â though the giant statue of Ramesses II makes this worth a stop.
There’s an excellent documentary on Netflix about one such tomb discovered in Saqqara. Worth a watch before you go (or even if you’re not).
Good for age: 13+

Hot-air balloon flights over Luxor
Luxor, Upper Egypt, Egypt
Bucket List Experience
Drifting silently over the ancient monuments of the West Bank, as the sun rises over the Nile, is one of those ânever forgetâ moments. Itâs a serene way to appreciate the layout of ancient Luxor, from the temples in the east to valley tombs in the west.
Peer into roofless village houses, unchanged for thousands of years, see the fertile floodplains of the Nile give way to the desert beyond, and marvel at the enormous scale of Karnak temple.
Adult price: Â£30
Good for age: 13+
Duration: 3 hours

Luxor Temple
Luxor, Upper Egypt, Egypt
Bucket List Experience
Unlike the complex at Karnak, which is connected by an avenue of sphinxes and which was built over the course of 1,500 years, the elegant Temple of Luxor was built mostly by one pharaoh, Amenhotep III.
As a result, it is much less complex than its counterpart, although the Romans made changes to the innermost part.
The temple used to be fronted by two colossal obelisks, but only one remains. Its twin was moved to the Place de la Concorde in Paris in the 1840s.
Adult price: Â£7
Good for age: 8+

Tomb of Queen Nefatari
Luxor, Upper Egypt, Egypt
Bucket List Experience
The Tomb of Queen Nefertari, located in the Valley of the Queens, is arguably one of the most beautiful tombs in all of Egypt.
Nefertari, the greatly loved wife of Pharaoh Ramses II, was a significant figure in ancient Egypt, renowned for her beauty and intellect. The exquisitely decorated tomb beautifully showcases her importance.
Its walls are adorned with detailed, vibrant frescoes depicting Nefertari’s journey to the afterlife, with numerous hieroglyphs and symbolic scenes of her interacting with various deities. The quality of the artwork is truly phenomenal, with each image and colour holding significant meaning, presenting a stunning blend of art and theology.
Despite the tomb’s discovery in a state of disarray in 1904, it has undergone extensive restoration. While the cost of entry is higher than other tombs, the quality of the art and the historical significance of Nefertari makes it an essential stop.
Adult price: Â£75
Good for age: 13+

Temple of Hatshepsut
Luxor, Upper Egypt, Egypt
Bucket List Experience
Queen Hatshepsut was one of the only women ever to rule Egypt and reigned during a golden period, and her impressive funerary temple is now one of the best-known monuments in Luxor.
Built on three terraces cut into the slopes of the Theban hills, it was mostly destroyed and reconstructed during the second half of the 20th century.
Some of the back walls and their decoration have survived and are of excellent quality.
Adult price: Â£7
Good for age: 13+

Tombs of the Nobles
Luxor, Upper Egypt, Egypt
Bucket List Experience
While the Tombs in the Valley of the Kings are decorated with the cryptic texts of the Book of the Dead, the Tombs of the Nobles reflect on the daily life led by their ancient inhabitants in the hope that it would continue in the afterlife.
This is a real find â the tombs here are superbly decorated and, in many ways, more evocative and insightful than those of the pharaohs. Itâs thankfully unspoilt compared to the Valley of the Kings, as it rarely features on tour group itineraries.
Adult price: Â£3
Good for age: 13+

Valley of the Artisans
Luxor, Upper Egypt, Egypt
Bucket List Experience
Deir el-Medina, also known as the Valley of the Artisans, was an ancient village inhabited by the skilled workers who constructed and decorated the royal tombs in the Valley of the Kings and Queens. In their spare time they built and decorated their own tombs.
The site provides a fascinating glimpse into the everyday lives of ancient Egyptians outside the nobility. The well-preserved village layout, complete with homes, workshops, tombs and a temple, coupled with various personal items and ostraca (inscribed pottery fragments), offers insights into the artisan community’s lifestyle, religion, and work.
While less grand than the pharaohs’ temples and tombs, for those seeking a deeper understanding of the society behind the grand structures, Deir el-Medina is an enriching, must-visit site.
Adult price: Â£5
Good for age: 18+

Unfinished Obelisk
Aswan, Upper Egypt, Egypt
Experience
This colossal structure, left incomplete around 1500 BC, offers a unique insight into ancient Egyptian stoneworking techniques. Had it been completed, it would’ve been the largest obelisk ever erected.
It was commissioned by the female Pharaoh Hatshepsut (1507â1458 BC) for the purpose of complementing the Lateran Obelisk, which is now in Rome, at the entrance to the Karnak Temple in Luxor.
Obelisks were often erected in pairs at the entrances to temples and were significant monuments in Ancient Egyptian religion, believed to act as a connection between the earth and the sun god, Ra. Unfortunately, the Unfinished Obelisk developed cracks during its construction â which can still be seen â and was subsequently abandoned.
Adult price: Â£5
Good for age: 8+

Temple of Seti I
Luxor, Upper Egypt, Egypt
Experience
Abydos was believed to be the burial place of the head of the god Osiris, and it was used as a necropolis for mortals from 4,000 BC- AD 600. One of Egyptâs finest temples was built here by Seti I in 1279 BC and dedicated to Osiris, Isis and their son Horus.
A little-visited temple, it retains an air of grandeur and mystery. The reliefs in the second hypostyle hall are some of the best of any surviving temple.
Adult price: Â£4
Good for age: 18+

Temple of Horus
Abydos, Upper Egypt, Egypt
Experience
One of the last Egyptian temples to be conceived and completed on a magnificent scale, the temple of Edfu was dedicated to the falcon-headed god Horus. Edfu had been a cult centre since 3000 BC, but this temple was started in 237 BC by Ptolemy III.
Following the pharaonic style, on the walls are carvings of Greek pharaohs dressed as Egyptians, making offerings to Egyptian gods. Two huge falcons at the entrance represent Horus.

Antarctica
Antarctica, Argentina
Bucket List Experience
To many, Antarctica is the ultimate cruise prize, for the wildlife, the incredible scenery and the sheer remoteness. Youâll be surrounded by mountains, some of them 8,000 feet high, their peaks and ridges softened by snow.
On fine days, the sky is an unfiltered cobalt blue. Vast, blue-white icebergs in dramatic shapes are strewn across the freezing sea. Penguins bustle about their business, seals bask on the rocks and whales feed in plankton-rich waters.
Stepping ashore is an incredible feeling, as is kayaking slowly through the ice. Some companies allow camping on the ice and even skiing, while others offer underwater drones and even tethered hot air balloons.
