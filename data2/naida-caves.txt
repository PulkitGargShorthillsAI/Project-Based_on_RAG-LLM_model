NAIDA-CAVES
A maze of wonder
Mysterious, shadowy and shrouded in history and legend, the Naida Caves offer a unique experience that transcends the ordinary. The origins of Naida Caves are as interesting as the caves themselves. Some contend that they are man-made, while others attribute their existence to natural forces.

During the Portuguese colonial era, Diu Fort served as their stronghold. Legend has it that the Portuguese extracted building materials from these very caves to construct the fort. Over time, the caves underwent natural wear and tear, sculpting their present form that include a big maze of tunnels with square hewn steps. Whether shaped by human hands or natureâ€™s whims, Naida Caves stand as silent witnesses to centuries gone by.
