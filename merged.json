As the sun dips below the horizon, the world seems to hold its breath, bathing the bridge and the Ganges below in a warm, golden glow. Watching the sunset from this vantage point is a breathtaking experience, as the vibrant hues of orange and pink paint the sky in a mesmerising display. And when the first rays of dawn begin to peek over the distant hills, the bridge is transformed once more, the cool morning light casting a serene spell in the air. To witness these natural wonders from the Mahatma Gandhi Setu is to feel the connection of nature with man-made structures.",

Known as the Agam Kuan, this ancient reservoir carries echoes of a dark and tumultuous past etched into its very stones.\n\nDating back an astonishing 2200 years, the well's forbidding presence looms near the historic Kumhrar archaeological site, transporting you to the time of Emperor Ashoka's brutal reign before he embraced Buddhism. As sunlight filters through the gnarled trees surrounding the well, you can almost envision the grisly scenes that once unfolded in its shadowed depths.\n\nAccording to a myth, the well has a subterranean link with the Patala (netherworld) or hell; this was inferred on the basis that a saint found a heavy log in the well which was supposed to have been lost in the sea. This belief was further reinforced by the fact that fire used to emanate from the well, which was also called the \u2018fiery well\u2019 or \u2018hell on earth\u2019. Emperor Ashoka knew about it and turned this into his chambers of torture, where offenders were thrown into a fiery abyss. It is even said that Ashoka used the well to dispose of his 99 brothers to secure his claim to the Mauryan empire's throne.",
